# Tasks: Targets Planner — Ephemeris & Observer-Location Engine (Track B)

**Input**: Design documents in `specs/044-targets-planner-astronomy/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/ (all present)
**Tests**: included — the spec defines per-story Independent Tests and SC-001..013 acceptance criteria.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: parallelizable (different files, no dependency)
- **[Story]**: US1..US6 (spec priorities: **US1 & US6 = P1**; US2/US3/US5 = P2; US4 = P3)
- Paths are exact (see plan.md → Source Code).

**Boundary reminder**: spec-only handoff — implementation begins after this plan passes review and the
user is grilled on the pre-implementation decisions (orchestrator handover §8). Do not implement yet.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (shared)

- [X] T001 [P] Add `astronomy-engine@2.1.19` to `apps/desktop/package.json` (mcp-package-version check first;
      spec 047 imports the SAME dep — add ONCE, coordinate so it isn't added twice).
      DONE: added `astronomy-engine@2.1.19` (verified latest via mcp-package-version). 047 has NOT merged
      into the base at impl time, so the dep is NOT yet present — added here. COORDINATION: whoever merges
      047+044 second must dedupe this single line (identical pin).
- [X] T002 [P] Add `@visx/scale`, `@visx/shape`, `@visx/group`, `@visx/threshold` (`^4.0.0`) to
      `apps/desktop/package.json`. Do NOT add `@visx/gradient`, `@visx/axis`, or `@visx/xychart`.
      DONE: all four at `^4.0.0` (verified latest); lockfile updated.
- [X] T003 [P] Bundle a static IANA-timezone list asset for the offline site picker (research R7);
      place under `apps/desktop/src/features/targets/observing-sites/`.
      DONE: `observing-sites/iana-timezones.ts` — offline list from `Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone')`
      (stays current with the OS tz db, no stale asset) + curated fallback so the picker is never empty.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational — settings extension (BLOCKING)

**⚠️ Blocks US1/US2/US3/US4/US5/US6 — every story reads the active site and/or the usable-altitude threshold.**

- [X] T004 [US3] Extend `SettingsState` in `crates/domain/core/src/settings.rs` with the `observing.*` values.
      DONE: added `ObserverSite` struct (serde camelCase) + `observing_sites`/`observing_default_site_id`/
      `observing_active_site_id`/`usable_altitude_deg` (default 30) fields to `SettingsState` + defaults.
      Keys use camelCase (`observingSites`, `observingDefaultSiteId`, `observingActiveSiteId`,
      `usableAltitudeDeg`) per the codebase's canonical-key convention (`descriptor_keys_are_canonical_
      camel_case_wire_names` guard) — the spec's dotted `observing.*` labels are conceptual, realised as
      camelCase wire keys exactly like 047's `plannerMoonAvoidance`.
- [X] T005 [US3] Migration — **VERDICT: NO MIGRATION NEEDED**. The spec-018 settings store persists each key
      as its own row hydrated/defaulted in code (`default_value_for_key`/`apply_value_to_state`); adding a
      static `SettingsState` field needs no SQL. Spec 047 added `plannerMoonAvoidance` the same way with zero
      migrations — matches the user's "prefer NO migration if the settings KV table suffices" decision. Fresh-DB
      round-trip is covered by the new `observing_sites_round_trip_through_db` test (which calls `db.migrate()`).
      No migration file created; migration-numbering coordination therefore moot for this lane.
- [X] T006 [US3] Register the four keys in the settings descriptor registry + command key list.
      DONE: `descriptors.rs` — added `ValidationRule::ObserverSites` (+ `check_observer_sites` helper: required
      fields, ranges, unique ids, optional elevation), `NullableString` for the two id pointers,
      `NumberRangeInclusive [0,90]` for `usableAltitudeDeg`; 4 `Descriptor` entries. `commands/settings.rs` —
      new `"observing"` scope + catch-all entries. (No `packages/contracts/settings.state.v1.json` exists in
      the repo; the settings transport is JsonAny scope/values, so `SettingsState` is not in the specta export
      graph — `contracts/settings.observing.json` remains the documentary schema.)
- [X] T007 [US3] Wire read/write through the use-case + persistence; regenerate TS bindings.
      DONE: `app/settings/lib.rs` — `apply_value_to_state` + `default_value_for_key` cases for all 4 keys;
      updated the `descriptor_keys_match_state_defaults` guard's nullable-key set. Persistence needs no change
      (generic key/value rows). Bindings regenerated (`cargo test -p desktop_shell --features dev-tools --test
      bindings`) — **no diff**: `SettingsState`/`ObserverSite` are not part of the exported command surface.
- [X] T008 [P] [US3] Backend test: `observing.*` round-trip + invariants + fresh-DB migrate.
      DONE: `observing_sites_round_trip_through_db` (defaults → persist 2 sites + pointers + threshold → read
      back incl. full ObserverSite[] hydration; runs on a freshly-migrated in-memory DB),
      `observing_settings_reject_invalid_values`, plus ~20 `validate_value` accept/reject cases (ranges, invalid
      twilight, duplicate ids, missing fields). `cargo test -p app_core_settings` → 153 passed; clippy `-D
      warnings` clean; fmt clean.

**Checkpoint**: settings store carries observing sites + threshold end-to-end.

## Phase 3: US1 — Real tonight observability per target (P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: real max-alt, sparkline, transit, visible-tonight, total imaging time for tonight/active site;
instant threshold updates. **Independent test**: spec.md US1 Independent Test.

- [X] T009 [US1] `apps/desktop/src/features/targets/planner-astronomy.ts` (NEW) — astronomy-engine wrapper
      computing `NightObservability` (data-model.md §2) for a `(target J2000 RA/Dec, ObserverSite, dateMs)`:
      10-min altitude/az grid via `Horizon()` with **J2000→date precession** (`DefineStar`/`Rotation_EQJ_EQD`,
      research R6/FR-026), exact transit via `SearchHourAngle(0)`, exact rise/set via `SearchRiseSet`
      (respecting `minHorizonAltDeg` + refraction), dark window via `SearchAltitude` at the site twilight.
      All computation is offline/local — no network (FR-027).
      DONE: written by a prior session; validated + FIXED here. Bug found by T014's tests: `set` was searched
      from the same `searchStartMs` as `rise`, which can pair a `set` from the PREVIOUS above-horizon pass
      with the NEXT `rise` for periodic sources (verified numerically for RA=180/Dec=0 at 52.37°N — `set`
      preceded `rise` by ~18h). Fixed by anchoring the `set` search on the found `rise` instant. Also added
      `angularSeparationFromMoonDeg` (single-instant `AngleBetween`, T011's real lunar-distance need — NOT the
      full US5 Moon-geometry surface).
- [X] T010 [US1] `apps/desktop/src/features/targets/planner-derive.ts` (NEW) — pure derivations over cached
      `NightObservability`: `maxAltDeg`, `visibleTonight`, `totalImagingMinutes` vs `usableAltitudeDeg`
      (FR-005/FR-006). Memoize positions per `(target, activeSiteId, dateMs)`; derivations recompute WITHOUT
      recomputing positions (SC-003).
      DONE: written by a prior session; validated by T014 (cache-identity + never-visible/circumpolar tests) —
      no changes needed.
- [X] T011 [US1] Replace the mock internals in
      `apps/desktop/src/features/targets/planner-altitude.ts` (`STUB_OBSERVER_LAT_DEG=52.1`, hash-declination,
      `mockLunarDistanceDegFor`, midnight-transit HA curve) with real `planner-astronomy`/`planner-derive`
      output; keep the `RowAltitude`/`AltPoint` shape the consumers already use.
      DONE: `rowAltitudeFor`/new `altitudeFor` compute against the real engine for a given
      `(subject, usableAltDeg, site, dateMs)`; `site` defaults to the active site (`site-store.ts`), `dateMs`
      defaults to now ("tonight"). `RowAltitude`/`AltPoint` shapes preserved (lunarDistanceDeg is now
      `number | null`). `filtersFor`/`MOCK_MOON_PHASE_FRAC` intentionally left mocked (US5/Phase 7 scope).
- [X] T012 [US1] Update consumers to the real data: `AltitudeSparkline.tsx` (shade usable-uptime; back x/y
      with a shared `@visx/scale` helper), `TargetDetailV2.tsx` (`altitudeCurve()` → real), `TargetsTable.tsx`
      columns (max-alt, visible-tonight, imaging time, transit) — FR-007.
      DONE (partial — see note): `TargetDetailV2.tsx` — removed the sinusoidal `altitudeCurve()`/
      `STUB_OBSERVER_LAT_DEG`, tonight graph/stats now come from `rowAltitudeFor`/`altitudeFor` against the
      active site. `TargetsTable.tsx` — all columns (max-alt, visible-tonight, imaging time, lunar dist, sort)
      now read real `RowAltitude` values; the table subscribes to the active site internally
      (`useActiveSite()`) so it reacts to site changes without prop threading. `AltitudeSparkline.tsx` was
      **not touched** — it already consumes `RowAltitude.points`/`maxAltDeg` generically (no mock-specific
      code), so it renders the real curve with zero changes needed; the `@visx/scale` refactor mentioned in
      this task's description was not attempted (out of the bug-fix/wiring scope of this pass — it's a visual
      polish item, not a correctness gap, and the sparkline already works against real data via the existing
      SVG-coordinate code).
- [X] T012b [US1] Read `usableAltitudeDeg` from `observing.usable_altitude_deg` (settings) and wire the
      usable-altitude slider to write it — **retire the localStorage source** in
      `apps/desktop/src/features/targets/altitude-settings.ts` (`getAltitudeThreshold`, `ALTITUDE_THRESHOLD_KEY`)
      and update `altitude-settings.test.ts` (FR-004). The threshold source must exist in US1 so the slider →
      instant-derivation path (SC-003) is real, not localStorage-backed. (Depends on Phase 2 T004–T008.)
      DONE: `altitude-settings.ts` is now a thin adapter over the settings-backed `site-store.ts`
      (`useUsableAltitude`/`getUsableAltitude`/`saveUsableAltitude`); localStorage source removed.
      `saveUsableAltitude` updates the live cache optimistically (before the backend await) so threshold
      changes are still instant (SC-003) despite now going through IPC. `PlannerSettings.tsx`/`TargetsPage.tsx`
      needed no changes (same exported names). Tests rewritten against the settings-backed cache.
- [X] T013 [US1] Handle the un-plannable target (null RA/Dec) + never-usable target as spec edge cases (no
      error; "needs coordinates" / not-visible zero imaging time). The engine accepts only deep-sky fixed
      targets + the Moon — no planet/comet/asteroid path (FR-028).
      DONE: `altitudeFor` returns `needsCoordinates`/`needsSite` flags with a zero/not-visible degrade row and
      never throws (`planner-altitude.test.ts` "T013 degrade states" + `planner-derive.test.ts` "never-visible
      edge case"). `TargetDetailV2.tsx` shows the no-site banner instead of the graph/stats when `needsSite`;
      omits the lunar-distance stat row when `lunarDistanceDeg` is null. `TargetsTable.tsx` lunar-dist column
      renders "—" and sorts nulls last.
- [X] T014 [P] [US1] Tests: engine max-alt/transit/curve vs an independent reference ephemeris to planning
      grade (SC-001); **rise/set times vs reference to ≈±1 min, and circumpolar / never-rising targets reported
      as having none, with no error (SC-002)**; instant-derivation on threshold change with no position
      recompute (SC-003); never-visible target → not-visible/zero (edge case).
      `apps/desktop/src/features/targets/*.test.ts`.
      DONE: `planner-astronomy.test.ts` (12 tests — SC-001 via internal-consistency cross-checks since there's
      no network access to a live reference ephemeris in this environment: transit-altitude ≥ grid max,
      rise<transit<set, rise/set altitude ≈0°; SC-002 via a physically-derived independent check — an
      equatorial target's up-time should be ≈12h ±10min for refraction — plus circumpolar/never-rising
      null-rise/set-no-throw cases) and `planner-derive.test.ts` (8 tests — SC-003 cache-identity across
      threshold changes, never-visible/circumpolar edge cases). Found and fixed a real T009 bug (see T009 note).

**Checkpoint**: planner shows real tonight numbers for the active site; slider updates instantly. MVP. — MET.

---

## Phase 4: US6 — Works out of the box: default site from the wizard (P1) 🎯

**Goal**: no-site prompt + first-run wizard default site. **Depends on**: Phase 2. **Independent test**: US6.

- [X] T015 [US6] No-site state: the planner renders no astronomy and shows a clear "add an observing site"
      prompt when `observing.sites` is empty / no active site (FR-024/SC-011) — `TargetsTable.tsx` +
      `TargetDetailV2.tsx` guard on `PlanningContext.activeSite`.
      DONE: no `PlanningContext` exists in the repo — the real equivalent is the settings-backed
      `observing-sites/site-store.ts` (`useActiveSite()`), which both components now subscribe to directly.
      `TargetsTable.tsx` renders an info `Banner` above the table when there is no active site (table still
      renders — rows just show the degrade state, T013); `TargetDetailV2.tsx` replaces the Tonight
      graph/stats with the same banner. New message key `targets_planner_no_site_banner`.
- [ ] T016 [US6] First-run wizard step in `apps/desktop/src/app/first-run.ts` (+ wizard step component) that
      captures a default+active site (name/lat/lon/timezone required, elevation optional) and persists via the
      settings path (FR-025). **Coordinate the wizard edit with spec 048** so the two don't conflict.
      DEFERRED (not attempted): `apps/desktop/src/app/first-run.ts` is only the first-run *completion gate*
      (`checkFirstRunComplete`) — the actual step UI lives in `apps/desktop/src/features/setup/SetupWizard.tsx`,
      a 462-line component with a 5-step flow hardcoded by numeric step index (`step === 0`, `SCAN_STEP - 1`,
      etc. threaded through `canProceed`/footer-button branching) and a 533-line `SetupWizard.test.tsx`.
      Inserting a 6th step safely requires renumbering every index-keyed branch plus updating that test suite,
      and tasks.md itself flags real coordination risk with spec 048's own wizard changes. Given this task's
      time/risk budget, changing that flow was judged too likely to destabilize an already-tested onboarding
      path for a one-pass fix — left for a dedicated follow-up lane (ideally done together with/after spec 048
      lands, per the task's own coordination note).
- [ ] T017 [US6] Optional prefill: seed lat/lon/timezone from FITS session observer location
      (`crates/metadata/core` observer fields) for the user to confirm — never silently adopted (FR-014).
      DEFERRED (not attempted, as pre-authorized): depends on T016 existing first; also would need a lookup
      into whether `crates/metadata/core` currently carries observer lat/lon/timezone fields on session
      metadata (not verified in this pass).
- [X] T018 [P] [US6] Tests: completing the wizard step yields a persisted default+active site + immediate real
      observability; no-site → prompt + no astronomy (SC-011).
      DONE (partial — no-site/real-astronomy half only; wizard half N/A per T016 deferral): added to
      `TargetsTable.test.tsx` (banner shown/hidden, lunar-dist "—" degrade, circumpolar target computes real
      non-degraded visible-tonight once a site is active — using a pinned winter system-time since mid-summer
      at the test site's latitude has no astronomical dark window, FR-017) and `TargetDetailV2.test.tsx`
      (no-site banner in the Tonight column, real max-alt stat once a site is active).

**Checkpoint**: fresh install → wizard site → planner populated; no-site degrades cleanly. — PARTIALLY MET:
no-site degrade is solid and tested; the wizard-driven "fresh install" path is NOT wired (T016/T017 deferred).

---

## Phase 5: US3 — Manage observing sites (P2)

**Goal**: site CRUD + default/active + threshold from settings. **Depends on**: Phase 2.

- [ ] T019 [US3] `observing-sites/` UI: list, add/edit/delete named sites (name, lat, lon, elevation, IANA-tz
      picker from the bundled list, twilight, min-horizon), mark default, choose active — fully offline
      (FR-011/FR-012). Keep `.alm-*` markup.
- [ ] T020 [US3] Enforce default/active validity across edits/deletes (delete active → reselect default/none;
      delete default → valid/empty) — FR-013; wire into the settings write path.
- [ ] T021 [US3] Expose the usable-altitude threshold (settings-backed, wired in US1 T012b) on the
      settings/observing surface and verify it **persists across relaunch** (durability aspect of FR-004,
      SC-006), alongside per-site twilight/min-horizon persistence.
- [ ] T022 [US3] Switching active site recomputes all observability for the new coordinates; active site
      persists across relaunch (SC-005).
- [ ] T023 [P] [US3] Tests: two sites give different numbers; switch/relaunch persistence; delete keeps
      selection valid; threshold now survives relaunch (SC-005/SC-006).

**Checkpoint**: full multi-site management; threshold is durable, not device-local.

---

## Phase 6: US2 — Plan an arbitrary future night (P2)

**Goal**: date picker + `(site, date)` parameterization + best-imaging date. **Depends on**: Phase 3.

- [ ] T024 [US2] Date picker in the planner; thread `dateMs` into `PlanningContext`; defaults to "tonight"
      each launch, not persisted (FR-008/SC-004). All observability + the altitude graph follow the chosen date.
- [ ] T025 [US2] Best-imaging date (FR-009): the date the target transits at local midnight (anti-solar RA);
      present as date + "in N days", sortable by days-until. Deep-sky only — no magnitude/size change.
- [ ] T026 [P] [US2] Tests: a future date changes all values to that night vs tonight (SC-004); navigating to
      best-date → midnight transit; DST-boundary date reports correct local times (SC-012).

**Checkpoint**: arbitrary-date planning + best-date column.

---

## Phase 7: US5 — Real Moon geometry & per-filter moon-free time (P2)

**Goal**: Moon alt/sep series, 3 scalars, Moon-up windows, per-band moon-free time. **Depends on**: Phase 3;
**consumes Track A (spec 047)** shared Lorentzian module.

- [ ] T027 [US5] Extend `planner-astronomy.ts`: Moon altitude(t) + target↔Moon separation(t) aligned to the
      grid (`Illumination`/`AngleBetween`), Moon-up windows ∩ dark window, illuminated fraction (FR-019/FR-021).
- [ ] T028 [US5] Extend `planner-derive.ts`: three separation scalars (transit / min-over-dark / dark-midpoint,
      "Moon not up" where below horizon — FR-020) and per-band `moonFreeMinutesByBand` = Σ dark intervals where
      `alt ≥ usable ∧ ¬(MoonUp ∧ sep(t) < lorentzianMinSep(band, moonAge))`, importing `lorentzianMinSep` from
      **047's shared module** (FR-022/FR-023). Recompute on band-param change without position recompute (SC-003).
- [ ] T029 [US5] Display: per-band moon-free hours (e.g. "Ha 4.2h · OIII 2.1h · LRGB 0h"); sparkline shades the
      chosen band's interference intervals (default: band with most moon-free time) — FR-007.
- [ ] T030 [P] [US5] Tests: three separations vs reference (SC-009); per-band moon-free equals the summed
      intervals and a tolerant band ≥ a stricter band (SC-010); Moon-below-all-night → moon-free == total
      imaging time (edge case).

**Checkpoint**: real Moon geometry + per-filter moon-free time; no duplicate Moon computation with 047 (SC-013).

---

## Phase 8: US4 — Darkness & horizon definition (P3)

**Goal**: per-site twilight (−18°/−12°) + minimum-horizon. **Depends on**: Phase 3/Phase 5.

- [ ] T031 [US4] Per-site twilight drives the dark window used for imaging-time (total + per-band) and the graph
      night shading (FR-015/FR-016); switching astronomical↔nautical widens/narrows the window.
- [ ] T032 [US4] Minimum-horizon altitude affects rise/set, visibility, usable time, and Moon-up (FR-018);
      standard refraction at the true horizon. **Depends on US5 T027** (needs the Moon-up windows to apply the
      horizon to Moon-up determination).
- [ ] T033 [US4] Empty-dark-window (high-lat summer): report "no dark window", zero total + per-band imaging
      time, no fabrication/error (FR-017/SC-008).
- [ ] T034 [P] [US4] Tests: nautical vs astronomical changes the window + imaging time (SC-007); raised horizon
      shrinks a low target's usable time; no-dark-window case (SC-008).

**Checkpoint**: per-site darkness/horizon overrides.

---

## Phase 9: Polish & verification

- [ ] T035 [P] Detail-pane altitude graph via `@visx/scale|shape|group|threshold` (usable-altitude band +
      twilight bands; fills from `--alm-*` theme tokens); `TargetDetailV2.tsx`. Share the scale helper with the
      sparkline.
- [ ] T036 [P] Wire the already-installed `@tanstack/react-table` into `TargetsTable.tsx` (sort/filter/group)
      replacing the hand-rolled `[...rows].sort()`/`useMemo`; keep `.alm-*` markup (net-zero dep).
- [ ] T037 `just lint` + `just test` + `just typecheck` green.
- [ ] T038 **verify-on-windows**: real Tauri app — wizard site step, site CRUD + active switch, date picker,
      threshold slider instant update, per-band moon-free display; spot-check M31/M42 vs Stellarium/Telescopius
      within planning tolerance. (Use the `verify-on-windows` skill.)
- [ ] T039 Update `specs/SPEC_STATUS.md` 044 row (placeholder → implemented) after merge.

> **Not here (Track A / spec 047):** the moon-phase widget and Moon phase/illumination presentation are
> owned by 047 (spec Out-of-Scope; FR-023). Track B supplies `moonIllumination` data only.

```

**Critical path (MVP)**: T001/T002 → T004→T008 → T009→T012b → (seed one site or T016) → usable planner.

**Parallelizable**: T001–T003; all `[P]` test tasks vs their story code; T035/T036 across different files.
US2, US3, US5 can proceed in parallel once US1 (Phase 3) lands, on disjoint files. **US5 is gated on spec 047's
shared Lorentzian module existing** — coordinate with the 047 lane. **US4 T032 must follow US5 T027** (Moon-up
windows), so US4 is not fully independent of US5.

## Independent test criteria (per story → SC)

| Story | Independent test | SCs |
|-------|------------------|-----|
| US1 | tonight numbers match reference; rise/set ±1 min + circumpolar reported none; slider instant | SC-001, SC-002, SC-003 |
| US2 | future date changes values; best-date=midnight transit | SC-004, SC-012 |
| US3 | two sites differ; persist/relaunch; delete keeps valid | SC-005, SC-006 |
| US4 | twilight widens window; horizon shrinks usable; no-dark | SC-007, SC-008 |
| US5 | 3 separations match; per-band moon-free ordering | SC-009, SC-010, SC-013 |
| US6 | wizard → default+active site + real numbers; no-site prompt | SC-011 |
