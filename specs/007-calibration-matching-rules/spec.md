# Feature Specification: Calibration Matching Rules

> **See Spec 030**: UI implementation of this feature must follow
> [Spec 030 — UI Audit & Revision](../030-ui-audit-revision/spec.md)
> for layout, navigation, and component patterns.

**Feature Branch**: `007-calibration-matching-rules`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Last Updated**: 2026-06-23
**Status**: Core implemented (31/42) — matching engine for bias/dark/flat + assign/ranking/candidate shipped (`crates/calibration/core/src/`). The 11 open tasks are all explicitly **DEFERRED** contract-test tasks (JSON-Schema test runner not yet in the workspace; domain guards already covered by unit tests), not unstarted work.
**Input**: User description: "Specify configurable calibration matching rules per calibration type, with recommendations and manual override."

## Implementation Status: UI scaffolding only

The desktop settings page at
`apps/desktop/src/features/settings/SettingsPage.tsx` currently exposes three
calibration controls — dark match tolerance, flat matching strategy, and a
"suggest calibration" toggle — backed by the local settings keys
`darkMatchTolerance`, `flatMatching`, and `suggestCalibration` in
`apps/desktop/src/data/settings.ts`. There is no matcher crate, no
recommendation engine, no contract, and no persistence wiring. The current UI
edits values that are never read by any matching logic. Everything in this
specification, plan, research, data model, contracts, and tasks describes
behavior that does not yet exist.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Dark Frame Matching (Priority: P1)

As an astrophotographer with light frames captured at specific gain, offset,
exposure, and sensor temperature, I want the app to recommend dark masters that
match these acquisition parameters so that calibration is correct without me
hand-walking every dark library.

**Why this priority**: Darks are the most parameter-sensitive calibration type
and the most common reason a project blocks during preparation. Without dark
matching the rest of the feature is not useful.

**Independent Test**: Load a light session with known gain, offset, exposure,
and temperature, configure dark rules with default tolerances, and verify the
returned ranked list contains exact-parameter dark masters first and
within-tolerance dark masters second, with confidence values reflecting
dimension match counts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a light session at gain 100, offset 50, exposure 300s, temperature
   -10C, **When** matching is requested, **Then** a dark master at identical
   gain/offset and exposure 300s within ±2C is returned with high confidence.
2. **Given** the same light session, **When** only out-of-tolerance darks
   exist, **Then** the response lists them with reduced confidence and a
   `dimensions_mismatched` array naming the failing dimensions.
3. **Given** dark match tolerance for temperature is widened in settings,
   **When** matching is re-requested, **Then** previously rejected darks now
   appear with confidence values reflecting the wider tolerance.

### User Story 2 - Flat Frame Matching (Priority: P2)

As an astrophotographer, I want flat masters recommended based on filter,
optical-train rotation, binning, and date proximity so that vignetting and
dust-mote correction matches the actual light frame capture state.

**Why this priority**: Flats are required for any project that integrates
multi-frame data, but their matching policy is workflow-dependent and benefits
from explicit configuration.

**Independent Test**: Load a multi-filter light session captured on a known
observing night, request flat matching, and verify each filter's recommended
flat master comes from the closest same-rotation, same-binning flat capture
night, with `dimensions_matched` showing filter, rotation, binning, and a
date-proximity score.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a light session with filter Ha and rotation 90°, **When** flat
   matching is requested, **Then** flat masters with matching filter and
   rotation from the same observing night are ranked above any other.
2. **Given** no same-night flats exist, **When** matching is requested,
   **Then** compatible flats from the nearest date are returned with confidence
   reduced for date proximity.
3. **Given** a flat master with a different binning, **When** matching is
   requested, **Then** it is excluded from the recommendation list because
   binning is a hard constraint.

### User Story 3 - Bias Frame Matching (Priority: P3)

As a user calibrating short-exposure or scaled-dark workflows, I want bias
masters recommended based on gain and offset alone so that bias is not blocked
by exposure or temperature requirements that do not apply.

**Why this priority**: Bias matching is the simplest case and only relevant for
some workflows, but it must not be conflated with dark matching rules.

**Independent Test**: Load a light session with bias-eligible workflow,
request bias matching, and confirm the recommendation set is filtered by gain
and offset only, with no exposure or temperature dimension entries in the
response.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** bias masters at matching gain/offset, **When** matching is
   requested, **Then** they are returned with confidence based on gain/offset
   match only.
2. **Given** bias masters whose gain differs, **When** matching is requested,
   **Then** they are excluded because gain is a hard constraint for bias.

---

### User Story 4 - Manual Override (Priority: P4)

As a user preparing a project, I want to assign a specific calibration master
even when it conflicts with the auto-recommendation so that I retain final
control over calibration decisions.

**Why this priority**: Override is essential trust behavior but only meaningful
once auto-matching produces something to override.

**Independent Test**: Auto-match a session, then call assign with a non-top
master and `override=true`, and verify the assignment is recorded with
confidence and a flag indicating it was an override.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a recommendation set, **When** the user assigns a master that is
   not the top recommendation with `override=true`, **Then** the assignment is
   persisted and the response reports the assigned master's confidence.
2. **Given** the user attempts to assign a master with incompatible hard-rule
   dimensions, **When** the request is sent without override, **Then** the call
   returns `incompatible.dimensions` and the assignment is not made.
3. **Given** the user retries the same incompatible assignment with
   `override=true`, **Then** the assignment is recorded with a lowered
   confidence and a mismatched-dimensions audit note.

### User Story 5 - Batch Calibration Suggestions (Priority: P2)

As a user preparing a project, I want to request calibration suggestions for
multiple light sessions at once so that project-wide calibration preparation
does not require a separate call per session.

**Why this priority**: A project may have dozens of light sessions across
multiple targets, filters, and nights. Batch suggestions make the project
preparation workflow practical.

**Independent Test**: Seed 3 light sessions with differing parameters, call
`calibration.match.suggest.batch` with all three session IDs, and verify
each session returns per-type candidates with correct `status` values
(`match`, `ambiguous`, `no_match`, or `observer_location_missing`). Verify
partial success: if one session lacks observer_location, that session returns
`observer_location_missing` while others return matches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple light sessions, **When** batch suggest is requested,
   **Then** each session receives independent ranked candidates per type.
2. **Given** one session has `observer_location: null`, **When** batch suggest
   is requested, **Then** that session's result returns
   `status: "observer_location_missing"` and others are unaffected.
3. **Given** a `calibration_types` filter is provided, **When** batch suggest
   is requested, **Then** only the requested types are evaluated per session.

### Edge Cases

- Darks without reliable temperature metadata fall back to gain+offset+exposure
  matching with reduced confidence.
- Flats captured after local midnight but belonging to the same observing
  night are grouped by observing-night semantics, not calendar date.
- Multiple light sessions on adjacent calendar dates do not share flats unless
  same-night/session grouping or compatibility fallback explicitly allows it.
- Missing camera or telescope metadata excludes the candidate from hard-rule
  matching and surfaces a "metadata gap" reason instead of a silent rejection.
- A user-provided master file (not directory) is treated as a single calibration
  master with metadata derived from headers, not from sibling files.

### Domain Questions To Resolve

- Default tolerance values per dimension (temperature, date proximity) at
  first launch.
- Whether bias matching should ever consider exposure for scaled-dark
  workflows, or treat exposure as implicit.
- Whether confidence is a single 0–1 scalar or a structured breakdown the UI
  must render.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The matching engine MUST support calibration types `dark`, `flat`,
  and `bias` in v1. `dark_flat` is reserved in the `CalibrationType` enum for
  forward-compatibility but MUST NOT be matched, suggested, or assigned in v1.
  Files with dark_flat IMAGETYP values land as `unclassified` at the inbox level
  (spec 005 ripple). The `dark_flat` slot MUST NOT appear in any Settings UI
  filter chip, assignment dropdown, or calibration type selector in v1.
- **FR-002**: Matching rules MUST be configurable independently per
  calibration type (dark, bias, flat).
- **FR-003**: Dark matching MUST default to gain (exact), offset (exact),
  exposure (±configurable tolerance), and temperature (±configurable tolerance).
- **FR-004**: Flat matching MUST default to filter (exact), rotation (±0.5°
  default), binning (exact), optic_train (exact), and date proximity scored
  against the light session's observing night.
- **FR-005**: Bias matching MUST default to gain (exact) and offset (exact),
  with exposure and temperature explicitly excluded unless configured.
- **FR-006**: System MUST return ranked recommendations with per-candidate
  confidence and explicit `dimensions_matched` / `dimensions_mismatched` lists.
- **FR-007**: Recommendations MUST remain advisory; manual override MUST be
  accepted via an explicit override flag.
- **FR-008**: Flat recommendations MUST prioritize same-session and
  same-observing-night flats before compatibility fallback.
- **FR-009**: Same-night flat matching MUST use observing-night/session
  semantics, not plain calendar-date equality.
- **FR-010**: Master calibration mode MUST allow selecting a file instead of a
  directory.
- **FR-011**: Matching explanations MUST be inspectable via the contract
  response, not only via UI tooltips.
- **FR-012**: Hard-rule mismatches (e.g., gain for darks, binning for flats)
  MUST exclude candidates from the auto list but MAY be assigned via override.

### Key Entities

- **Calibration Type**: Dark, bias, flat, or dark flat.
- **Matching Rule**: Selected metadata fields, tolerances, and hard/soft
  classification per calibration type.
- **Calibration Master**: A calibration artifact (file or directory) with
  extracted metadata used as the right-hand side of matching.
- **Calibration Match**: Candidate relationship between a light session and a
  calibration master with confidence and dimension breakdown.
- **Observing Night**: The acquisition night/session grouping used to associate
  after-midnight captures with the same practical imaging session.
- **Manual Override**: User-selected assignment that supersedes the auto-pick
  and is recorded with override provenance.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can configure dark, bias, and flat matching independently
  from a single settings surface.
- **SC-002**: For a session with complete metadata, the matcher produces at
  least one ranked candidate per applicable calibration type when masters
  exist.
- **SC-003**: Manual override is preserved across project edits and reported in
  the response payload.
- **SC-004**: Flat recommendation responses indicate whether each candidate
  was selected by same-session, same-night, or compatibility fallback.
- **SC-005**: Recommendation responses surface every excluded dimension so the
  UI can render a "why not" view without a second call.

## Assumptions

- Light frames are the anchor for project calibration recommendations.
- Metadata extraction (specs 003/004) can provide camera, telescope, filter,
  exposure, gain, offset, binning, and temperature where headers contain them.
- The session and observing-night concepts come from the sessions crate and
  are already populated for any candidate light session.

## Out of Scope

- Pixel-level calibration validation.
- Automatic application of calibration to images.
- Cross-library master sharing.
- Authoring new calibration masters (the matcher consumes existing masters).
