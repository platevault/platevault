# Implementation Plan: Cleanup And Archive Review Plans

**Branch**: `017-cleanup-archive-review-plans` | **Date**: 2026-05-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/017-cleanup-archive-review-plans/spec.md`

## Summary

Reviewable filesystem plans are the gating surface between plan *generation*
(by per-origin generators) and plan *application* (by spec 025's executor).
This spec defines the review state machine, list/detail UX, approve gate,
discard rules, and retry-as-new-plan semantics. The current `apps/desktop/`
mockup already implements the surface end-to-end against an in-memory store;
this plan documents the architecture so the same surface can be backed by real
generators and the durable plan store.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.78 (workspace), TypeScript 5.5 (desktop shell).  
**Primary Dependencies**: Tauri 2 IPC, React 18, Mantine 7 (UI), serde + JSON
Schema for contracts, SQLite via the `crates/persistence/db/` boundary.  
**Storage**: SQLite is canonical for plans, plan items, and audit events.
Generated archive manifests and source views are reproducible projections.  
**Testing**: `cargo test --workspace` for crates, `pnpm test` (Vitest) for
desktop, contract-driven JSON Schema tests for the operation surface.  
**Target Platform**: Tauri desktop on Windows/macOS/Linux.  
**Project Type**: Desktop app + workspace crates.  
**Performance Goals**: List render under 100 ms for ≤200 plans; detail render
under 150 ms for ≤2000 items.  
**Constraints**: Plan generation MUST be read-only; review actions MUST be
durable and audited; retry MUST never mutate the parent plan.  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user local libraries with plan histories of low
thousands; per-plan item counts up to ~10⁵ for restructure plans.

## Constitution Check

- **Local-first file custody**: Plans reference user-owned paths via library
  roots + relative paths. The plan store is metadata-only; no image files are
  copied or moved by review actions in this spec.
- **Reviewable filesystem mutation**: This *is* the review surface. No item
  mutation happens here; apply is owned by spec 025. Approve is the explicit
  gate; retry is a new plan with an audit trail.
- **PixInsight boundary**: No calibration/registration/integration is added.
- **Research-led domain modeling**: Plan state vocabulary, retry semantics,
  default ordering, cancellation semantics, and platform-specific trash/archive
  behavior are decided in `research.md` before implementation.
- **Portable contracts and durable records**: All review operations are
  defined as language-neutral JSON Schema contracts under `contracts/`. The
  durable record is in SQLite (`crates/persistence/db/`); manifests projected
  from the plan store are reproducible.
- **Cross-platform path safety**: Paths in the plan model are stored as
  `(root_id, relative_path)` pairs; review-side rendering MUST tolerate
  missing roots without losing plan history.

## Architecture

Plan generators per origin emit plans; this spec defines the review surface;
spec 025 defines the apply executor.

                                                  │                                          │
                                                  └───────────────► durable plan store ◄─────┘
                                                                  (crates/persistence/db/)
```

Boundaries:

- **Generators** live behind use cases in `crates/app/core/` and write only
  *new* plans + items. They never edit existing plans.
- **Review surface** (this spec) reads plans + items and writes only the
  review-side states (`draft`, `ready_for_review`, `approved`) plus discard.
- **Apply executor** (spec 025) writes only the apply-side states (`applying`,
  `applied`, `partially_applied`, `failed`, `cancelled`) and per-item state
  transitions.

Crate touchpoints:

- `crates/fs/planner/`: already models plans and items. This spec sharpens the
  review state machine and adds `parent_plan_id` to the entity.
- `crates/app/core/`: hosts the review use cases — `list_plans`, `get_plan`,
  `approve_plan`, `discard_plan`, `retry_plan`.
- `crates/contracts/core/`: Rust DTOs mirroring the JSON Schema contracts.
- `crates/audit/`: every review write emits an audit event.
- `crates/persistence/db/`: tables for plans, plan items, audit events.
- `packages/contracts/`: language-neutral JSON Schemas (the contracts in this
  spec).
- `apps/desktop/`: existing mockup pages migrate from the mock store to the
  Tauri command surface bound to the contracts.

**Structure Decision**: Reuse the existing monorepo layout. No new crates are
required; this spec sharpens behavior on already-bounded crates and adds
contracts to `packages/contracts/`. UI lives in the existing
`apps/desktop/src/features/plans/` folder.

## Ratified Decisions Folded

The following decisions from GRILL_DECISIONS_2026-05-22 are now reflected in
this spec's artifacts:

| Ref | Summary |
|-----|---------|
| A1 | `approvalToken` HMAC in `plan.approve` response; no TTL |
| A2 | Per-item FS revalidation replaces 15-min TTL |
| A3 | `itemsSkipped` + `itemsCancelled` counters; invariant updated |
| A4 | `totalBytesRequired` pre-flight field on Plan |
| A5 | `discarded` state: soft-delete terminal, `discardedAt` timestamp |
| A6 | Canonical path verification at apply; Phase 3 blocker task in spec 025 |
| A7 | Event bus topics: plan lifecycle + per-spec topics registered on spec 002 §6.3 |
| R-Env-1 | All contracts: camelCase, `contractVersion`, `requestId`, status-discriminated envelope |
| R-FS-1 | `approvedMtime`/`approvedSizeBytes` on PlanItem; populated at approve time |
| R-Ret-1 | Plan list age cutoff 90 days (configurable via spec 018 follow-up) |
| R-Archive-1 | Archive location: `<library_root>/.astro-plan-archive/<planId>/` |
| R-Trash-1 | OS trash available in v1 (OVERRIDE); per-plan `destructiveDestination` |
| R-Archive-2 | `archive.send_to_trash` + `archive.permanently_delete` contracts (new) |
| R-Retry-1 | Default retry filter `failed`; cancelled plans get separate "Retry cancelled" CTA |
| R-Chain-1 | Retry chain UI: flat `parentPlanId` link in detail header, no tree widget |
| E5 | `cancelled` added to PlanItem.state enum |
