# Feature Specification: Onboarding Redesign — Three-Layer Onboarding

**Feature Branch**: `spec/056-onboarding-redesign`

**Created**: 2026-07-18

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "Replace the spec 010 guided sequential coach with a
three-layer onboarding system: a one-time modal orientation walk after first-run
setup, per-page Getting Started checklists in a shared sidebar accordion with
backend-authoritative auto-ticking from real domain events, and per-item
find/magnify spotlights on the real controls. No demo data ever. Old guided-flow
machinery is deleted."

**Supersedes**: [Spec 010 — Guided First Project Flow](../010-guided-first-project-flow/spec.md).
This feature replaces the sequential in-app coach wholesale. The old guided
state machine, its commands, its overlay, and its stored state are removed, not
adapted. This is a greenfield replacement: no upgrade or migration path is
provided for previously stored guided-coach progress beyond deleting it.

## Product Intent

New users finish the first-run setup wizard knowing *that* the app organizes an
astrophotography library, but not *where* anything happens or *what to do
first*. Spec 010 answered this with a single sequential coach that walked one
scripted path (confirm → project → tool). In practice a real library workflow is
not a single path: users arrive with different libraries, skip stages, and
return days later mid-flow. The redesign separates three distinct needs:

1. **Orientation** ("what is where") — a one-time, deliberately modal walk
   across the real pages immediately after setup, before the user has any
   context to lose. This is a documented exception to the product's non-modal
   norm: for the 60 seconds after setup completes there is nothing else the
   user could productively be doing, and undivided attention is the point.
2. **Direction** ("what should I do next, per page") — persistent, glanceable
   per-page Getting Started checklists that tick themselves off as the user
   does real work, in any order, over any number of sessions.
3. **Location** ("show me the exact control") — an on-demand spotlight per
   checklist item that highlights the real control on the real page,
   non-modally, without taking over the workflow.

Progress is earned by real domain activity, never simulated. The checklist
reflects what actually happened in the library — a completed item means the
underlying work truly exists on disk and in the database. No demo or sample
data is ever created (carried forward from spec 010 FR-009).

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-07-18

Run unattended against the approved decision record (grill 2026-07-18). Answers
that go beyond the literal record are provisional and are also logged in
[PENDING_REVIEW_QUESTIONS.md](PENDING_REVIEW_QUESTIONS.md).

- Q: Does the initial seeding of automatic items (first activation, not just
  restore) derive from actual recorded library state? → A: Yes — one seeding
  routine for both first activation and restore; automatic items reflect
  already-met milestones from the moment the section first appears
  (provisional).
- Q: Can an individual manually-checked or dismissed item be reverted? → A: No
  per-item undo in v1; manual states are permanent — restore re-derives
  automatic items only and never discards user progress (provisional; scope
  narrowed by review fix 2026-07-18).
- Q: What does the find affordance do when the item's control lives on a
  different page than the current one? → A: It navigates to the item's page
  first, then renders the spotlight; the route-change dismissal rule applies to
  navigations occurring after the spotlight renders (provisional).
- Q: Does the Getting started section auto-hide once every item is complete? →
  A: Yes (RESOLVED by user directive 2026-07-18): a page group whose items are
  all checked/dismissed collapses to its one-line header with a done checkmark;
  when ALL groups are complete/dismissed the entire section auto-hides; the
  Settings → Advanced restore control brings it back.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - First-Run Orientation Walk (Priority: P1)

Immediately after the first-run setup wizard finishes, the app launches a
guided orientation walk: a modal, page-by-page tour that navigates the real
application pages in workflow order, spotlights each whole page, and shows one
or two sentences of "this is where X happens" copy per stop. After the five
workflow pages, a final stop spotlights the sidebar Getting started section and
introduces the checklists — the bridge from orientation into ongoing guidance.
The user can move Next/Back on every stop, Skip at any time, or press Escape to
end the walk.
Finishing or skipping marks orientation done forever; it never auto-runs a
second time. It can be replayed on demand from Settings → Advanced.

**Why this priority**: Orientation is the first thing a brand-new user
experiences and the cheapest way to remove "where does anything happen"
confusion. It is self-contained and delivers value even if no other layer
ships.

**Independent Test**: Complete the first-run wizard in a fresh profile; the
walk starts, visits each workflow page in sequence with visible spotlight and
copy, ends on the sidebar Getting started section stop, responds to
Next/Back/Skip/Escape, and never reappears after finish or skip across app
restarts. Replay works from Settings → Advanced.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh install where the first-run setup wizard just completed,
   **When** the main window appears, **Then** the orientation walk starts
   automatically in modal mode on the first stop.
2. **Given** the walk is on any stop, **When** the user activates Next or Back,
   **Then** the walk navigates to the real neighboring page and spotlights it
   with its orientation copy.
3. **Given** the walk is on any stop, **When** the user activates Skip or
   presses Escape, **Then** the walk closes immediately and orientation is
   marked done forever.
4. **Given** orientation was finished or skipped, **When** the app restarts,
   **Then** the walk does not auto-run.
5. **Given** orientation is done, **When** the user activates the replay
   control in Settings → Advanced, **Then** the walk runs again from the first
   stop, and finishing or skipping it again leaves orientation marked done.
6. **Given** the walk is on the last workflow page, **When** the user activates
   Next, **Then** the final stop spotlights the sidebar Getting started section
   and introduces the checklists, and finishing from there marks orientation
   done.

### User Story 2 - Per-Page Getting Started Checklists (Priority: P2)

The sidebar carries one shared "Getting started" accordion section, placed
above the pinned Settings entry. It shows an overall progress line and one
group per workflow page — Inbox, Sessions, Calibration, Targets, Projects —
matching the sidebar's workflow-stage order (no groups for Archive, Settings,
or setup). Each group holds 2–4 items with 3–5 word labels; hovering or
focusing an item reveals a one-sentence fuller description in a tooltip. The
group for the currently visited page is auto-expanded; other groups collapse to
one line with a completed/total count. Items that depend on an upstream
milestone (for example "Create your first project" needs at least one confirmed
inventory item) show a prerequisite state with a reason and a jump link to the
page where the prerequisite is met. When the sidebar is icon-collapsed, a
progress-ring icon represents the section and opens the checklist as a
non-modal popover. The section is expanded by default from first visit; a
user's collapse choice is persisted.

**Why this priority**: The checklists are the persistent core of the redesign —
they guide real multi-session workflows long after the one-shot walk ends.

**Independent Test**: With onboarding active, visit each workflow page and
verify its group auto-expands with 2–4 items; verify overall progress line,
per-group counts, tooltips, prerequisite reasons and jump links, popover
behavior in icon-collapsed mode, and persistence of expand/collapse across
restarts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** onboarding is active, **When** the user opens any workflow page
   whose group still has open items, **Then** that page's checklist group is
   expanded in the sidebar accordion and all other groups show as one line
   with a completed/total count. A complete group stays as its one-line done
   header even on its own page (FR-031 precedence) and can still be expanded
   manually.
2. **Given** an item whose prerequisite milestone is missing, **When** the user
   views or focuses the item, **Then** it presents a prerequisite state with a
   human-readable reason and a jump link that navigates to the upstream page.
3. **Given** the sidebar is icon-collapsed, **When** the user activates the
   progress-ring icon, **Then** the checklist opens as a non-modal popover with
   the same content, and the rest of the app stays interactive.
4. **Given** the user collapses the Getting started section, **When** the app
   restarts, **Then** the section stays collapsed until the user expands it.

### User Story 3 - Automatic Completion from Real Work (Priority: P3)

Checklist items that correspond to observable domain milestones tick themselves
automatically when the real event happens — confirming inventory, creating a
project, launching a processing tool, and other real recorded milestones. All
other items are manually checked off or dismissed by the user. When an item
completes (automatically or manually) it never simply disappears: the row shows
a check animation and brief emphasis in place, then moves to a completed
(greyed, checked) area at the bottom of its page group. Automatic ticks
additionally pulse the section progress line (or the progress ring when
collapsed) so a side-effect tick is witnessed even if the user is looking
elsewhere. Under reduced motion, the state change happens without animation.
Completion state is authoritative and durable: it reflects what actually
happened in the library, survives restarts, and is never triggered by restoring
or replaying past records.

**Why this priority**: Auto-ticking is what makes the checklist trustworthy —
it proves the app observed real work rather than asking users to bookkeep.

**Independent Test**: Perform a real inventory confirm, project create, and
tool launch; verify the matching items tick automatically with the completion
choreography and progress pulse, survive restart, and that restoring or
replaying historical records never produces a tick.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an unchecked auto item for confirming inventory, **When** the user
   confirms an inbox item for real, **Then** the checklist item ticks
   automatically, plays the completion choreography, and the section progress
   pulses.
2. **Given** a manual item, **When** the user checks it off or dismisses it,
   **Then** it plays the same completion choreography (without the auto-tick
   progress pulse) and moves to the completed area of its group.
3. **Given** any completed item, **When** the app restarts, **Then** the item
   remains completed.
4. **Given** stored history is restored or replayed by the system, **When**
   restore-sourced records are processed, **Then** no checklist item ticks as
   a result.
5. **Given** the user has reduced motion enabled, **When** any item completes,
   **Then** the state change is applied without animation or pulse.
6. **Given** a page group with one remaining open item, **When** that item is
   checked or dismissed (auto or manual), **Then** after the completion
   choreography the group collapses to its one-line header with a done
   checkmark — even when it is the current page's group (precedence over
   FR-007 auto-expand); a manual toggle can still reopen it.
7. **Given** every group is complete or dismissed, **When** the last item
   settles, **Then** the entire Getting started section (and its progress-ring
   icon) auto-hides; the Settings → Advanced restore control brings it back.

---

### User Story 4 - Find-It Spotlight on the Real Control (Priority: P4)

Every checklist item carries a find/magnify affordance. Activating it renders a
non-modal spotlight over the real control on the real page that the item is
about. The spotlight pulses for the first few seconds, then settles to a static
outline; under reduced motion it never pulses. It is dismissed by clicking the
spotlighted control, clicking anywhere else, pressing Escape, toggling the find
affordance again, or navigating to another page — and it is never dismissed on
a timer. The spotlight overlay may span and dim the sidebar.

**Why this priority**: The spotlight closes the last gap — "I know what to do,
show me exactly where" — but is only useful once checklists exist.

**Independent Test**: For each checklist item, activate find, verify the
correct control is spotlighted non-modally, verify all five dismissal paths
work and no time-based dismissal occurs, and verify reduced-motion suppresses
the pulse.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a checklist item with a find affordance, **When** the user
   activates it, **Then** a spotlight highlights the item's real control while
   the rest of the app stays interactive.
2. **Given** an active spotlight, **When** the user clicks the target, clicks
   anywhere else, presses Escape, toggles the find affordance, or changes
   pages, **Then** the spotlight dismisses.
3. **Given** an active spotlight, **When** the user does nothing, **Then** the
   spotlight persists indefinitely (pulse settles to a static outline; it never
   auto-dismisses on a timer).

---

### User Story 5 - Removal, Restore, and Replay Controls (Priority: P5)

A small menu in the Getting started section header offers "Remove getting
started" with a one-line confirmation; confirming hides the section
permanently. Settings → Advanced carries the single restore/reset control for
onboarding (alongside the orientation replay). Restoring unhides the section
(whether removed explicitly or auto-hidden on completion) and re-derives
AUTOMATIC items from the actual database state: if confirmed inventory,
projects, or tool launches already exist, the corresponding items come back
pre-ticked. Manually checked and dismissed items keep their state — restore
never discards real user progress.

**Why this priority**: Experienced users must be able to opt out cleanly, and
returning users must be able to bring the checklist back without it lying about
work already done.

**Independent Test**: Remove the section via the header menu and verify it
stays hidden across restarts; restore from Settings → Advanced in a library
that already has confirmed inventory and a project, and verify those automatic
items return pre-ticked, unmet automatic items return unchecked, and manually
checked/dismissed items keep their prior state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Getting started section is visible, **When** the user chooses
   "Remove getting started" and confirms the one-line prompt, **Then** the
   section (and its collapsed progress-ring icon) disappears permanently,
   surviving restarts.
2. **Given** onboarding was removed or auto-hidden on completion, **When** the
   user activates restore in Settings → Advanced, **Then** the section returns
   and every automatic item whose milestone already exists in the library is
   pre-ticked.
3. **Given** onboarding was restored, **When** milestones that never happened
   are inspected, **Then** their automatic items are unchecked (never falsely
   ticked).
4. **Given** items were manually checked or dismissed before restore, **When**
   restore completes, **Then** those items still carry their manual state.

### Edge Cases

- App closes mid-orientation-walk: the walk was neither finished nor skipped;
  on next launch it auto-runs again from the first stop (auto-run only stops
  after an explicit finish or skip).
- The real control an item points to is not currently rendered (empty state,
  hidden panel): the find affordance communicates why the control is
  unavailable instead of spotlighting nothing.
- Two candidate anchors exist for one item (historically the inbox confirm
  control was anchored in two places): exactly one target must be resolved so
  the spotlight is deterministic.
- A domain milestone happens while the orientation walk is running: the tick is
  recorded; the checklist reflects it after the walk closes.
- A domain milestone happens while its page group is not expanded or the
  sidebar is icon-collapsed: the progress line or progress ring pulses so the
  tick is witnessed.
- Prerequisite met while the dependent item is visible: the prerequisite state
  clears without requiring a page reload.
- User removes the section while a spotlight is active: the spotlight
  dismisses with the section.
- Restore is activated twice in a row: idempotent — same re-derived result, no
  duplicate items, manual states untouched both times.
- Restore in a library where everything is still complete: the section returns
  visible in its fully-complete state and does not immediately auto-hide again
  (auto-hide fires only on a new settling transition, FR-031).
- Automated end-to-end tests of unrelated features must be able to suppress
  onboarding surfaces deterministically (the old coach had such a suppression
  path; a replacement is required).
- Reduced motion is enabled mid-session: subsequent animations and pulses are
  suppressed without restart.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Layer 1 — Orientation walk

- **FR-001**: The orientation walk MUST launch automatically exactly once,
  immediately after the first-run setup wizard completes.
- **FR-002**: The walk MUST be modal (a documented, deliberate exception to the
  product's non-modal norm), MUST navigate the real pages in workflow
  sequence, and MUST present a whole-page spotlight with short "this is where X
  happens" copy on every stop. The walk MUST end with a final stop anchored on
  the sidebar Getting started section that introduces the checklists (the
  L1→L2 bridge): the five FR-006 workflow pages plus this section stop = six
  stops.
- **FR-003**: Every stop MUST offer Next, Back, and Skip controls, and Escape
  MUST end the walk from any stop.
- **FR-004**: Finishing or skipping the walk MUST mark orientation done
  forever; the walk MUST never auto-run twice. Closing the app mid-walk without
  finishing or skipping MUST NOT mark it done.
- **FR-005**: The walk MUST be replayable on demand from Settings → Advanced;
  replay MUST NOT alter the done-forever auto-run rule.

#### Layer 2 — Getting started checklists

- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide per-page Getting Started checklists for
  Inbox, Sessions, Calibration, Targets, and Projects — 2 to 4 items per page —
  and MUST NOT provide checklists for Archive, Settings, or setup surfaces.
- **FR-007**: All checklists MUST be presented as one shared sidebar accordion
  section placed above the pinned Settings entry, with an overall progress
  line, per-page groups matching the sidebar's workflow stages, the current
  page's group auto-expanded (unless that group is complete — FR-031 takes
  precedence), and other groups rendered as one line with a completed/total
  count.
- **FR-008**: Item labels MUST be 3–5 words, with a fuller one-sentence
  description available in a tooltip on hover and on keyboard focus.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST NOT create demo, sample, or placeholder library
  data for any onboarding purpose (carried forward verbatim from spec 010
  FR-009).
- **FR-010**: Items whose upstream milestone is missing MUST present a
  prerequisite state with a human-readable reason and a jump link to the page
  where the prerequisite is satisfied (e.g. "Create your first project"
  requires at least one confirmed inventory item).
- **FR-011**: When the sidebar is icon-collapsed, the section MUST be
  represented by a progress-ring icon that opens the checklist as a non-modal
  popover.
- **FR-012**: The section MUST be expanded by default from first visit; the
  user's collapse choice MUST be persisted across restarts.
- **FR-013**: A small menu in the section header MUST offer "Remove getting
  started" behind a one-line confirmation; confirming MUST hide the section
  permanently (across restarts) until explicitly restored.
- **FR-014**: Settings → Advanced MUST carry the single restore/reset control.
  Restore MUST unhide the section (whether hidden by explicit removal, FR-013,
  or by completion auto-hide, FR-031) and MUST re-derive AUTOMATIC items only
  from the actual recorded library state: milestones that already exist
  (confirmed inventory, projects, tool launches) come back pre-ticked;
  milestones that never happened come back unchecked. Manually checked and
  dismissed items MUST keep their state across restore — restore never
  discards real user progress. Restore MUST be idempotent. The initial seeding
  of automatic items on first activation MUST use the same recorded-state
  derivation as restore.

#### Completion semantics

- **FR-015**: Automatic ticks MUST derive only from real recorded domain
  milestones — confirming inventory, creating a project, launching a
  processing tool with a successful spawn, and any additional real milestones
  the design phase verifies are already observable. The v1 scope MUST NOT
  invent new milestone signals; milestones that are not yet observable are
  recorded as follow-ups and their items are manual.
- **FR-016**: Records processed during a restore or replay of history MUST
  never produce a tick.
- **FR-017**: Every item that is not auto-ticked MUST be manually checkable and
  dismissable by the user. No per-item undo is provided in v1; manual states
  persist across restore (FR-014 re-derives automatic items only).
- **FR-018**: On completion (auto or manual) an item MUST NOT simply disappear:
  it MUST play a check animation with brief row emphasis in place, then move to
  a completed (greyed, checked) area at the bottom of its page group.
- **FR-019**: Automatic ticks MUST additionally pulse the section progress line
  (or the progress ring when icon-collapsed) so side-effect ticks are
  witnessed.
- **FR-020**: Under reduced motion, all completion choreography MUST degrade to
  an immediate state change without animation or pulse.
- **FR-021**: All onboarding progress and flags (orientation done, item states,
  section hidden — removed or auto-hidden — and applicable collapse state) MUST
  persist across app restarts
  and MUST reflect authoritative recorded state — identical regardless of which
  screen was open when the milestone happened.

#### Layer 3 — Find-it spotlight

- **FR-022**: Every checklist item MUST offer a find/magnify affordance that
  renders a non-modal spotlight on the item's real control on the real page.
  If the item's page is not the current page, activating find MUST navigate to
  that page first and then spotlight; the route-change dismissal (FR-023)
  applies to navigations after the spotlight renders.
- **FR-023**: The spotlight MUST dismiss on: clicking the spotlighted target,
  clicking anywhere else, pressing Escape, toggling the find affordance, or a
  page/route change. It MUST NOT be dismissed on a timer.
- **FR-024**: The spotlight MUST pulse for the first few seconds then settle to
  a static outline; under reduced motion it MUST NOT pulse.
- **FR-025**: The spotlight overlay MAY span and dim the sidebar.
- **FR-026**: Each item MUST resolve to exactly one spotlight target; ambiguous
  or duplicate anchor targets MUST be resolved to a single deterministic
  target.

#### Cross-cutting

- **FR-027**: The old guided coach MUST be fully removed: no sequential coach
  UI, no legacy guided commands or stored guided state are honored. No
  migration of legacy guided progress is performed beyond its deletion
  (greenfield).
- **FR-028**: All user-facing onboarding text MUST be localizable through the
  application's translation catalog; no hardcoded user-facing strings.
- **FR-029**: All onboarding surfaces MUST be fully keyboard operable, MUST
  announce state changes (walk stops, ticks, spotlight open/close) to
  assistive technology, MUST manage focus correctly on open/close, and MUST
  meet WCAG 2.2 AA.
- **FR-030**: Automated tests of unrelated features MUST have a deterministic
  way to suppress all onboarding surfaces.
- **FR-031**: A page group whose items are all checked or dismissed MUST
  collapse to its one-line header with a done checkmark. When ALL groups are
  complete or dismissed, the entire Getting started section (including the
  progress-ring icon) MUST auto-hide. The auto-hide is a transition triggered
  when the last open item settles; after a restore (FR-014) the section stays
  visible — even if still fully complete — until a new settling transition or
  an explicit removal (FR-013) hides it again. Completion takes precedence
  over FR-007's current-page auto-expand: a complete group renders as its
  one-line done header even when it is the current page's group; the user can
  still expand it manually as a normal accordion toggle (which does not
  re-enable auto-expand).

### Key Entities

- **Onboarding item**: One checklist entry, identified stably, belonging to
  exactly one workflow page group; has a label, tooltip description, optional
  prerequisite (reason + jump destination), an optional automatic milestone,
  and a find target.
- **Item state**: Per-item lifecycle — unchecked, automatically checked,
  manually checked, or dismissed — with when and from what source the state was
  set.
- **Orientation state**: Whether the one-time walk has been finished or
  skipped (done forever) and replay availability.
- **Section flags**: Whether the Getting started section is hidden (by
  explicit removal or by completion auto-hide — both cleared by restore), and
  the persisted collapse state.
- **Domain milestone**: A real recorded library event (inventory confirmed,
  project created, tool launched, and other verified observable milestones)
  that can complete an item automatically and that seeds restore.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A first-time user reaches the end of the orientation walk (or
  skips it) in under 2 minutes, and the walk never auto-appears again across
  any number of restarts.
- **SC-002**: When a user performs a real milestone action (inventory confirm,
  project create, tool launch), the matching checklist item visibly completes
  within 2 seconds, without any page reload.
- **SC-003**: 100% of automatic ticks are backed by a real recorded domain
  milestone; restoring or replaying history produces zero ticks; zero demo or
  sample data exists anywhere in the product.
- **SC-004**: After remove + restore in a library with prior real work, every
  already-met automatic milestone item is pre-ticked, every unmet automatic
  item is unchecked, and every manually checked or dismissed item keeps its
  state — no false positives, no false negatives, no lost user progress.
- **SC-005**: All onboarding flows are completable keyboard-only, and under
  reduced motion no onboarding animation or pulse plays.
- **SC-006**: A user can locate the control for any checklist item via the
  find spotlight in under 10 seconds, and every one of the five dismissal
  paths works; no spotlight ever auto-dismisses on a timer.

### Validation Contract

- **VC-001**: Journey **J18** (authored separately in `docs/journeys/`) is the
  behavioral contract for this feature; the feature is done when J18 validates
  against the running product.
- **VC-002**: The Playwright mock suite validates UI semantics: the orientation
  walk including the skip path, the accordion behavior, the spotlight dismissal
  matrix, persistence flags, and accessibility. Known limit (documented): in
  mock mode the real event path is a no-op, so auto-ticking is NOT validated
  there.
- **VC-003**: Layer-1 (real-backend integration) tests assert that the three
  core milestone events actually publish from the real use cases, that the
  backend subscriber records the corresponding ticks, and that restore-sourced
  events are inert.
- **VC-004**: One Layer-2 end-to-end journey (real UI → real IPC → real
  backend) walks orientation, performs a real inventory confirm, and asserts
  the live auto-tick appears.
- **VC-005**: The feature's coverage row is present in
  `specs/037-e2e-integration-testing/contracts/coverage-matrix.md` (row added
  by the validation lane; referenced here as part of done).

## Assumptions

- Greenfield replacement: the only handling of legacy guided-coach state is
  deletion; no user-visible migration is required.
- The first-run setup wizard (spec 003/038) remains the trigger boundary: the
  orientation walk starts only after the wizard reports completion.
- The set of workflow pages (Inbox, Sessions, Calibration, Targets, Projects)
  is stable for v1; adding a page later means adding a checklist group, not
  redesigning the section.
- Single-user, single-instance desktop app: no concurrent-writer conflicts on
  onboarding state.
- The existing suppression mechanism used by automated tests for the old coach
  is retired with it; a replacement suppression path ships with this feature
  (FR-030).
- Checklist item copy (labels, tooltips, orientation stop copy) is authored at
  design time in the translation catalog; final wording may be tuned without
  re-specification.
