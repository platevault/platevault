# Implementation Plan: Settings Configuration Model

**Branch**: `018-settings-configuration-model` | **Date**: 2026-05-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/018-settings-configuration-model/spec.md`

## Summary

Settings are workflow-grouped, one-per-line, auto-saved configuration values
that drive application behavior across data sources, ingestion, naming,
calibration, tools, catalogs, cleanup, source protection, logging, and
appearance. The implementation today is a desktop-side mockup wired to
localStorage. The plan promotes the mockup to a backend-canonical settings
store: a single `SettingsStore` value type owned by `crates/app/core`, persisted
in the library SQLite database, exposed through versioned JSON contracts, and
read+written through Tauri commands. The desktop continues to wire each
SettingsPage row through `useSettings()` and a typed `updateSettings(key, value)`
mutator. Theme remains a separate concern with its own persistence key.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+ (backend), TypeScript 5.x (desktop)
**Primary Dependencies**: Tauri (desktop adapter), `crates/app/core`,
`crates/persistence/db` (SQLite), `crates/audit`, `crates/contracts/core`
**Storage**: SQLite settings table in the library database; theme persists
separately in browser localStorage under `alm.theme`.
**Testing**: `cargo test --workspace` for use-case and contract round-tripping;
desktop unit tests for the settings hook and the no-op guard; contract tests
using `packages/contracts` JSON Schemas.
**Target Platform**: Desktop (Tauri on Windows/macOS/Linux).
**Project Type**: Desktop application with a layered Rust core.
**Performance Goals**: Settings reads must not block UI render (cached in
desktop store); single-key writes complete in <50ms p95 against a cold SQLite.
**Constraints**: Single-window application; no cross-tab coordination required
in v1. Audit log must not amplify noisy keys.
**Scale/Scope**: A bounded set of v1 keys (14 flat keys + 12 absorbed keys
including structured-path patterns) plus per-source overrides keyed by source
ID.

## Constitution Check

- **Local-first file custody**: PASS. Settings drive but never own image files.
  Library roots remain modeled separately.
- **Reviewable filesystem mutation**: PASS. Settings changes are not filesystem
  mutations; destructive defaults (`blockPermanentDelete`,
  `defaultProtection`, `protectedCategories`) feed reviewable plans elsewhere
  rather than triggering writes.
- **PixInsight boundary**: PASS. Calibration matching settings configure how
  Astro suggests inputs to PixInsight; they do not run calibration here.
- **Research-led domain modeling**: PASS. Persistence shape, migration
  strategy, audit policy, and override resolution are research questions in
  `research.md` rather than assumed.
- **Portable contracts and durable records**: PASS. The four operations are
  defined as language-neutral JSON Schemas under `contracts/` and versioned via
  the `v1` storage key. SQLite is the durable record; the desktop snapshot is
  a derived cache.
- **Cross-platform path safety**: N/A for the settings model itself; the
  `pattern` value is a structured token list, not a string, so platform path
  rules are enforced where patterns are materialized, not where they are
  stored.

**Structure Decision**: The settings model is a vertical slice that spans the
desktop edge and the Rust core. The desktop hook stays the user-facing API.
The Rust use-case crate becomes the canonical writer once Tauri-bound. The
contracts directory is the boundary that decouples them.

## Architecture

### Canonical Source

`SettingsStore` (Rust, `crates/app/core/usecases/settings.rs`) is the canonical
source of settings values once persistence lands. It owns:

- Loading the row set from SQLite on startup, hydrating defaults for missing
  keys.
- Validating an incoming `(key, value)` pair against the v1 JSON Schema.
- Writing the change inside a transaction with an `audit` event for non-noisy
  keys.
- Returning `prior_value`, `new_value`, and an optional `audit_id`.

The desktop maintains a typed in-memory snapshot fed by the initial
`settings.get` response, and applies optimistic updates locally on
`settings.update` success.

### Desktop Wiring

`SettingsPage.tsx` reads through `useSettings()` and writes through
`updateSettings(key, value)`. Today this hook talks to localStorage; once the
Tauri adapter is in place, `updateSettings` dispatches the
`settings.update` command and applies the returned `new_value` back into the
local store on success. The no-op guard runs both before and after dispatch
to keep behavior identical when offline.

### Persistence (Future, Replaces localStorage)

A `settings` table holds `(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value JSON, updated_at)`. A
`source_overrides` table holds `(source_id TEXT, key TEXT, value JSON,
updated_at, PRIMARY KEY(source_id, key))`. Defaults are not stored; missing
rows are hydrated from the in-code default table at read time. This keeps
default churn cheap and audit-free.

### Schema Versioning

The storage key (`alm.settings.v1`) embeds the schema version. The SQLite
schema versions globally; key-level schema versioning is intentionally not
adopted because version-coupled migrations are simpler at the table grain.
Reads against a stored payload with an unknown key drop the unknown key and
emit one `warn`-level audit entry. Reads against a known key with an invalid
value reset that key to its default and emit one `warn`-level audit entry.

### Audit Policy

Every successful update of a non-noisy key creates one `audit` event with
`source = "settings"`, `level = "info"`, the key, the prior value, and the new
value. `pattern` and `protectedCategories` are noisy and do not generate
per-change audit entries; instead, a `settings.snapshot` audit event captures
their state at:

1. **Session start** — on library open.
2. **Debounced inactivity (R-Aud-1)** — after any noisy-key write, a 5-minute
   inactivity debounce emits one `settings.snapshot` once quiet. The timer
   resets on each noisy write and fires exactly once. The "page close" trigger
   is dropped in favour of this debounce. Timer state is per-session and is
   cancelled on library close.

Restoring defaults emits one `audit` event per restored key (for keys where
the value actually changed; already-at-default keys emit no event — R-3.1).

T017 and T020 implementation notes: provision a debounce timer in the
use-case; test reset-on-write and fire-once-on-quiet behaviour.

### Default Restore

`settings.restore-defaults` with an empty `keys` array restores every key.
With a non-empty array, only the listed keys are restored. Restoring a key
issues an update through the same code path as `settings.update` so that
audit, no-op guard, and validation behavior are uniform.

### Theme

Theme persistence remains in `apps/desktop/src/app/theme.tsx` under the
`alm.theme` localStorage key. Reasons: it is read on first paint before the
backend channel is ready; it is per-device rather than per-library; it must
not block on Tauri startup; and it should not pollute the settings audit
stream. The Appearance section in Settings reads/writes through the theme
module, not through `useSettings()`.

## Absorbed Key Special Handling

### `devMode` — compile-time gating

`devMode` is present in the settings schema unconditionally, but the
use-case layer enforces compile-time behavior:

- **`dev-tools` build**: `devMode` is read/write; the developer surface is
  shown when `true`.
- **Release build**: `settings.get` returns `devMode: false` regardless of
  stored value; `settings.update` on `devMode` returns `value.invalid`
  (read-only in this build). The Settings UI row is hidden entirely.

This is enforced via a `#[cfg(feature = "dev-tools")]` branch in the
use-case module. No schema migration is needed: the row may be present or
absent; both are handled uniformly.

### Structured-path keys — regex validation

Keys in the form `tools.<tool_id>.bundle_id`,
`workflow_profile.<profile_id>.watch_extensions`, and
`workflow_profile.<profile_id>.launch_attribution_window_hours` are validated
by regex in the use-case before the value schema is checked. An unrecognised
`<tool_id>` or `<profile_id>` slug (one that has no registered ToolProfile or
WorkflowProfile row) returns `key.unknown`. A recognised slug with an invalid
value returns `value.invalid`.

The `key` field in `settings.update` and `settings.restore-defaults` contracts
accepts these patterns via a `oneOf` combining the existing flat-key enum with
three `pattern` alternatives (see `contracts/settings.update.json`).

### Per-frame-type override_penalty

`calibration.dark.override_penalty`, `calibration.flat.override_penalty`, and
`calibration.bias.override_penalty` are three independent keys. The contracts
validate the frame-type slot via a regex `^calibration\.(dark|flat|bias)\.override_penalty$`.
All three share the same value schema: `number` in `[0, 1]`.

### `target_lookup.active_catalogs` — runtime default

No stored row means "all installed catalogs are active". The use-case
resolves the default dynamically from the spec 014 catalog manifest rather
than from an in-code literal list. Unknown catalog ids in a stored array are
filtered with a `warn` audit entry (consistent with R2 unknown-key policy).

### JSON-array keys

`target_lookup.active_catalogs` (`string[]`),
`workflow_profile.<profile_id>.watch_extensions` (`string[]`), and
`imagetyp_normalization.user_mappings` (`object[]`) are stored as
JSON-encoded arrays in the `settings.value` column. Deep structural equality
(R4.1) applies; element order is significant.
