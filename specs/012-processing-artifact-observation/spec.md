# Feature Specification: Processing Artifact Observation

**Feature Branch**: `012-processing-artifact-observation`  
**Created**: 2026-05-09  
**Last Updated**: 2026-05-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Specify how the app observes outputs from PixInsight, Siril, planetary/lunar tools, and future workflow profiles without becoming the processing tool."

## Implementation Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

No code lands for this feature. Mockup state for the Tool Launches drawer
accordion is the only visible surface today (see feature 011 desktop mock).
Architecture, contracts, and tasks below define the future-build target.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Detect New Files In A Project's Output Folder (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the app to notice files that appear in a project's
expected output folder so that processing results show up alongside the
project without manual import.

**Why this priority**: detection is the foundation. Until the app sees
the file, classification and surfacing are moot. P1 also satisfies the
constitution's PixInsight Boundary — the app *observes* what PixInsight
or Siril wrote, it does not write the file itself.

**Independent Test**: launch the desktop app with a project pointing at
an output folder. Drop a representative `.xisf` or `.fits` file into the
folder from outside the app. Within the configured debounce window the
file appears in the project drawer's Tool Launches accordion as an
unclassified artifact with a detection timestamp.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a project has an output folder configured, **When** a new
   file with a recognized processing extension is written to that
   folder, **Then** a `ProcessingArtifact` row is recorded with the
   project id, absolute path (resolved through library root), and a
   detection timestamp.
2. **Given** a file is renamed or replaced in the output folder,
   **When** the watcher fires, **Then** the existing artifact's
   `detected_at` is updated and an audit event records the change
   rather than creating a duplicate row.
3. **Given** a file is deleted outside the app, **When** the project is
   rescanned, **Then** the artifact transitions to `missing` rather
   than disappearing silently.

### User Story 2 - Classify Artifacts As Intermediate / Master / Final (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want detected files to be classified so that I can tell at
a glance which files are throwaway intermediates and which are the
final result of a processing session.

**Why this priority**: detection alone produces a noisy list. Coarse
classification (intermediate / master / final) gives the user enough
signal to prioritise review. Manual override is part of the user
story — heuristics are never silently authoritative.

**Independent Test**: drop a set of representative files into the
output folder (`integration_*.xisf`, `MasterDark_*.xisf`,
`<target>_final.tif`). Each artifact appears classified per the
workflow profile's rules with a confidence value. The user changes one
artifact's kind via the contract and the override is recorded.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a detected file matches a workflow-profile naming
   heuristic, **When** the classifier runs, **Then** the artifact's
   `kind` is set to one of `intermediate`, `master`, or `final` with a
   `classification_confidence` between 0 and 1.
2. **Given** a user manually overrides an artifact's kind, **When** the
   override is applied, **Then** the new kind, the source
   (`manual_override`), and an audit event are recorded; subsequent
   re-classifications do not silently revert the user choice.
3. **Given** a file is unknown to all loaded workflow profiles,
   **When** the classifier runs, **Then** the artifact is recorded
   with `kind = intermediate` and `classification_confidence < 0.2`,
   surfaced as "needs review" rather than dropped.

### User Story 3 - Surface Artifacts In The Project Drawer (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want observed artifacts to appear in the project drawer's
Tool Launches accordion so that processing results are visible next to
the launch that produced them.

**Why this priority**: surfacing depends on detection (P1) and is
clearer with classification (P2). Grouping under Tool Launches ties
each artifact to a launch when one exists (feature 011 cross-spec).

**Independent Test**: open a project drawer; the Tool Launches
accordion section lists each tool launch followed by the artifacts
that appeared in the output folder after the launch's start time,
grouped by `kind` with a count badge.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project has artifacts and tool launches, **When** the
   drawer renders, **Then** artifacts are grouped under their nearest
   preceding launch by detection timestamp.
2. **Given** an artifact has no preceding launch (manual processing),
   **When** the drawer renders, **Then** it appears under an
   "Unattributed" group.
3. **Given** an artifact is `missing`, **When** the drawer renders,
   **Then** the row visibly distinguishes the missing state and offers
   a "Mark resolved" affordance via the classify contract.

### Edge Cases

- Output folder is on a removed external drive: watcher unavailable;
  detection pauses without losing existing rows.
- Same artifact appears under multiple names (symlinks, hardlinks): the
  app records the first observed canonical path and treats links as
  references (constitution forbids following symlinks unless enabled).
- A user runs PixInsight and writes the file before the watcher has
  attached: the on-attach reconciliation scan must catch the file.
- Workflow profile rules change after artifacts were observed: existing
  classifications stay; the user can request a reclassify per project.
- Very large output folders: bounded debounce window (default 2s) and
  paged listing keep UI responsive.

### Domain Questions To Resolve

- Exact extension allow-list per workflow profile (see research.md).
- Default debounce window and watch-vs-poll selection per platform.
- Whether `final` requires a manifest cross-reference (feature 024).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The app MUST observe a project's configured output folder
  and detect newly written files matching the active workflow profile.
- **FR-002**: Each observed file MUST become a `ProcessingArtifact` row
  with `project_id`, `path`, `tool`, and `detected_at` recorded.
- **FR-003**: Each artifact MUST carry a `kind` of `intermediate`,
  `master`, or `final`, plus a `classification_confidence` value.
- **FR-004**: Classification MUST be driven by workflow-profile rules,
  not hardcoded per UI surface.
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to manually override classification;
  overrides MUST persist across re-detection and re-classification.
- **FR-006**: Missing files MUST transition to a `missing` state rather
  than being deleted from the index silently.
- **FR-007**: The app MUST NOT write to, modify, or process the
  observed files. Observation is read-only.
- **FR-008**: Artifact detection and classification MUST emit audit
  events (`artifact.detected`, `artifact.classified`,
  `artifact.classify.override`, `artifact.missing`).
- **FR-009**: Artifacts MUST be surfaceable in the project drawer's
  Tool Launches accordion, grouped by nearest preceding launch.

### Key Entities

- **Processing Artifact**: Output file observed under a project,
  classified as intermediate / master / final, optionally associated
  with a tool launch.
- **Artifact Classifier Rule**: Workflow-profile-scoped naming or
  extension pattern that maps an observed file to a kind and tool.
- **Artifact State**: Present, missing, or user-resolved.
- **Workflow Profile**: Tool-specific configuration (feature 011 cross-spec).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Dropping a known PixInsight master file into a project's
  output folder results in a classified artifact in the drawer within
  the debounce window.
- **SC-002**: PixInsight and Siril rules coexist without UI hardcoding.
- **SC-003**: Missing artifacts remain auditable after rescan.
- **SC-004**: Manual classification overrides survive a re-scan.

## Cross-References

- Feature 011 (Processing Tool Launch): supplies the `tool_launch_id`
  used to attribute artifacts to a launch.
- Feature 024 (Project Manifests And Notes): manifests snapshot the
  set of `final` artifacts at lifecycle checkpoints.
- Feature 001 (Library Manager): library-root abstraction resolves
  artifact paths across removed/remapped drives.

## Assumptions

- Processing tools own actual processing.
- Project artifact observation is local-filesystem based.
- Each project has at most one active output folder per workflow.

## Out of Scope

- Running workflow scripts or invoking PixInsight/Siril.
- Editing, transcoding, or compressing artifact files.
- Uploading artifacts to remote services.
- Diffing or comparing artifact contents.
