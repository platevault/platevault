# Implementation Plan: Filesystem Plan Application

**Branch**: `025-filesystem-plan-application` | **Date**: 2026-05-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/025-filesystem-plan-application/spec.md`

## Summary

Implement the **apply executor** for reviewed filesystem plans. Plans arrive
from spec 017 (Cleanup And Archive Review Plans) in `approved` state with an
approval token. The executor walks items sequentially, performs the requested
filesystem operation (move, archive, remove generated source view, delete via
trash), writes audit events per item state transition, and computes a
terminal plan state (`applied`, `partially_applied`, `failed`, `cancelled`)
once all items resolve. Item-level retry, item-level skip, and run-level
cancellation are also owned here. Plan-level retry (creating a new plan from
failed items of a terminal one) belongs to 017.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+ (executor crate), TypeScript 5+ (Tauri command surface), shared via `packages/contracts/`.
**Primary Dependencies**: `tokio` (long-running operation), `serde`/`serde_json` (contracts), `thiserror` (failure taxonomy), `tracing` (audit instrumentation). No new heavy deps. Filesystem primitives via std::fs + `fs_extra` (cross-volume copy-then-delete) gated by research outcome.
**Storage**: SQLite via `crates/persistence/db/`. The `plans` and `plan_items` tables are shared with 017; this feature adds `plan_apply_events` for audit and may add a `plan_runs` row per apply attempt.
**Testing**: `cargo test --workspace` for crate logic; Vitest for the desktop adapter; Playwright MCP for the apply panel.
**Target Platform**: Tauri desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux).
**Project Type**: Monorepo (Rust workspace + Tauri/React app + language-neutral JSON Schemas).
**Performance Goals**: Plan with 10k items emits item progress events within 50 ms of state transition; idle-time CPU during apply <10% baseline outside of FS I/O.
**Constraints**: No image processing. No silent overwrite. Filesystem writes go through `crates/fs/planner/` primitives. Cancellation must halt within one item boundary.
**Scale/Scope**: Plans up to ~10k items; single active apply per plan at a time; one machine.

## Constitution Check

- **Local-first file custody**: Yes. Source files stay where the user put them. The apply executor only mutates paths the user approved in the reviewed plan. Library roots are referenced via the path model owned by `crates/fs/inventory/`.
- **Reviewable filesystem mutation**: Yes. Apply is gated by an approval token from 017. Every item attempt writes an audit event (`PlanApplyEvent`). Destructive items prefer trash/archive via the existing planner primitives.
- **PixInsight boundary**: Yes. The executor performs filesystem operations only — no calibration, debayer, stack, drizzle, or image edit.
- **Research-led domain modeling**: Cross-platform move semantics, archive vs trash by OS, failure taxonomy, partial-progress preservation, and per-item retry primitives are documented in `research.md`.
- **Portable contracts and durable records**: Apply, cancel, item-skip, and item-retry are JSON Schemas under `contracts/`. SQLite holds durable audit records; Tauri is the first adapter.
- **Cross-platform path safety**: Atomic same-volume rename where possible; copy-then-delete across volumes; explicit handling of permission, conflict, source-missing, removable-drive eject. See research.md.

No violations. No complexity tracking entries.

**Structure Decision**:

- The apply executor lives in a **new** crate `crates/fs/executor/` so it can be
  tested without pulling in the planner's generation logic or the persistence
  adapter. It depends on `crates/fs/planner/` (plan shapes), `crates/audit/`
  (events), and exposes a `tokio` async driver behind a trait so tests can
  substitute an in-memory filesystem.
- Use-case wiring lives in `crates/app/core/src/usecases/plan_apply.rs` and
  composes executor + persistence + audit + contracts DTOs.
- The four contracts are JSON Schema in `specs/025-.../contracts/` (this
  spec is the source of truth) and code-generated into Rust
  (`crates/contracts/core/`) and TypeScript (`packages/contracts/`).
- The mockup `simulateApply` in `apps/desktop/src/data/store.ts` remains the UI
  source until the real executor is wired through Tauri.

### Idempotency & transactionality

- Apply is **idempotent on re-apply for `approved` plans**: items in
  `succeeded` are skipped, items in `failed` are preserved (not retried
  automatically), items in `pending` are executed.
- Each item state transition is written inside a SQLite transaction along
  with its audit event row so the UI can never observe a state without the
  corresponding event.
- The plan terminal state row update is also transactional with the final
  audit event.

## Ratified Decisions Folded

The following decisions from GRILL_DECISIONS_2026-05-22 are now reflected in
this spec's artifacts:

| Ref | Summary |
|-----|---------|
| A2 | No TTL on approval token; per-item FS revalidation is freshness mechanism |
| A4 | `totalBytesRequired` pre-flight; plan creation fails if space insufficient |
| A6 | Canonical path check at apply start; Phase 3 blocker task added |
| A7 | Event bus topics: `plan.applying.started`, `plan.item.progress`, `plan.applying.paused`, `plan.applying.resumed`, `plan.applying.completed` |
| R-Env-1 | All contracts: camelCase, `contractVersion`, `requestId`, status-discriminated envelope |
| R-Run-1 | `PlanApplyRun` mandatory SQLite table; created on apply start |
| R-Fail-1 | `copy.succeeded.delete.failed` + rollback policy; `copy.succeeded.delete.failed.rollback.failed` |
| R-FS-1 | Per-item FS revalidation before each mutation; `item.stale` → `paused` |
| R-Concur-1 | Concurrency: strictly sequential within a plan; cross-plan overlap check |
| R-Pause-1 | Pause/resume state machine; `plan.resume` contract |
| R-CAS-1 | Atomic CAS on apply start; `plan.invalid_state` on race |
| R-Trash-1 | OS trash semantics per platform; `os_trash.*` error codes |

## Pause State Machine (R-Pause-1)

```
applying → paused       on: volume.unavailable | disk.full | item.stale
paused   → applying     via: plan.resume (after condition resolves)
paused   → cancelled    via: plan.cancel
```

The `plan.resume` contract re-validates the pause condition before resuming.
If the condition is unchanged the server returns the appropriate fault code.
The UI shows a dialog with context-appropriate action prompts:
- `volume.unavailable` → "Remount drive" / "Cancel run"
- `disk.full` → "Free space" / "Cancel run"
- `item.stale` → "Regenerate plan" / "Cancel run"
Once the user resolves the condition, "Resume" becomes enabled.
