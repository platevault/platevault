# Implementation Plan: Desktop Prototype Design System

**Branch**: `022-mantine-prototype-design-system` | **Date**: 2026-05-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/022-mantine-prototype-design-system/spec.md`

## Summary

The desktop prototype uses `@base-ui-components/react` for headless
primitives (menu, dialog, tooltip, accordion, select, switch, popover),
`cmdk` for command-palette fuzzy matching, `react-resizable-panels` for
the docked drawer, and `@tanstack/react-table` rendered through an
`alm-table-*` CSS skin for ledger tables. Visual decisions resolve to
CSS custom properties defined in `apps/desktop/src/styles/tokens.css`,
applied via `alm-*`-prefixed rules in
`apps/desktop/src/styles/components.css`. Theme mode is controlled by a
`data-theme` attribute on the document root and a `ThemeProvider`
context (`apps/desktop/src/app/theme.tsx`). This plan ratifies the
existing mockup as the prototype's design system and locks the
`theme.get` / `theme.set` contracts for the UI-to-core boundary.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (desktop app), Rust 1.7x (future
backend contract implementation)
**Primary Dependencies**: `@base-ui-components/react`, `cmdk`,
`react-resizable-panels`, `@tanstack/react-table`,
`@tanstack/react-router`, React 18, Tauri 2.x.
[Floating UI](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui) is inherited
transitively through Base UI's Positioner components for all anchor-positioned
primitives (Popover, Tooltip, Select, Menu, Autocomplete) — collision
detection, flip/shift middleware, arrow placement, and scroll-aware
repositioning. We do NOT depend on Floating UI directly. Spec 010's guided-
tour overlay (built on [Shepherd](https://github.com/shipshapecode/shepherd))
uses the same positioning engine, so the entire app shares one positioning
runtime.
**Storage**: `localStorage` key `alm.theme` for theme persistence in
the desktop prototype. A future backend may persist theme in the
settings store; the contracts already model that boundary.
**Testing**: Vitest for primitive prop shape and theme reducer logic;
Playwright MCP for in-app theme switching and primitive accessibility
smoke. No snapshot testing; styling is verified by token resolution.
**Target Platform**: Desktop (Tauri shell on Windows/macOS/Linux).
**Project Type**: Desktop application with a single SPA entry.
**Performance Goals**: Theme switch under 16ms (single attribute
write triggers CSS variable re-resolve, no React re-render of the
entire tree); primitives must not introduce a styled-component runtime.
**Constraints**: No Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS, no Mantine, no
shadcn/ui. All visuals must be expressible through CSS variables.
**Scale/Scope**: ~20 primitives under `apps/desktop/src/ui/`, one
tokens file, one components file, ~9 feature pages.

## Constitution Check

- **Local-first file custody**: PASS. The design system stores no user
  data; theme preference lives in localStorage on the desktop edge.
- **Reviewable filesystem mutation**: N/A. The design system does not
  mutate user files.
- **PixInsight boundary**: PASS. The design system does not touch
  image processing.
- **Research-led domain modeling**: PASS. Framework choice, token
  taxonomy, and headless-library composition are decided in
  `research.md`.
- **Portable contracts and durable records**: PASS. `theme.get` and
  `theme.set` are language-neutral JSON Schemas under `contracts/`,
  so a future backend-driven settings layer can implement them.
- **Cross-platform path safety**: N/A for the design system layer.

```

**Structure Decision**: The design system lives entirely under
`apps/desktop/src/`. The primitive layer is intentionally co-located
with the desktop app (not a separate package) because the prototype is
single-app and extraction would slow iteration. When a second consumer
appears, the `ui/` and `styles/` folders can be lifted into a shared
package without API changes — that is the explicit reason every
primitive accepts `className` and spreads remaining props.

## Architecture

### Token System

The token system in `apps/desktop/src/styles/tokens.css` is the
single source of truth for color, typography, spacing, density,
shadow, radius, timing, z-index, and app-shell metrics. Tokens are
declared on `:root` and overridden under `[data-theme="light"]` and
`[data-theme="dark"]` scopes. The `:root:not([data-theme])` selector
inside `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` provides the
"system" mode behavior without JavaScript.

Component CSS files must reference tokens via `var(--…)` and must
not hardcode color, spacing, radius, shadow, or motion. The one
carve-out is `font-family`: font-stack literals (e.g.
`system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`) may appear as literal values
because they reference platform names, not design choices
(D-022-1, GRILL 2026-05-22). Token coverage for `font-size`,
`font-weight`, and `line-height` still applies.

**Density levels (A2, GRILL 2026-05-22)**: Two levels are supported
in v1 — `dense` (compact desktop-optimised row heights) and
`comfortable` (relaxed spacing for lower-density screens). The
`--row-h` alias points to the active density. A third `compact`
level is deferred to v1.x. Density switching is a CSS variable swap
only; no JS re-render is required.

**Token additions process (A4, GRILL 2026-05-22)**: Adding a new
token to `tokens.css` requires (1) updating `/DESIGN.md` with the
token's name, category, and rationale, and (2) passing adversarial
review confirming no existing token already covers the use case.
New tokens must be added before new components use them; this is
enforced by review, not tooling, in v1.

**`alm-` prefix convention (R-022-PrefixConvention, GRILL
2026-05-22)**: The `alm-` class prefix is a greppable convention.
Reviewers enforce it; no build-time lint exists in v1. A CI
check is deferred to v1.x.

**DESIGN.md location (A1, GRILL 2026-05-22)**: The canonical design
document lives at `/DESIGN.md` (repo root). The file already exists
(created in commit `314292a`). T032 must reference that path; the
task is not to create the file but to ensure it is kept current and
references this spec.

### Headless Primitive Layer

Base UI (`@base-ui-components/react`) provides accessibility and
keyboard plumbing for menu, dialog, tooltip, accordion, select,
switch, and popover. Primitives in `apps/desktop/src/ui/` wrap a Base
UI element, attach `alm-*` class names, and forward unrecognized
props onto the root element. They do not introduce a styling runtime.

Headless companions:

- `cmdk` — command palette fuzzy matching and item navigation.
  Composed inside a Base UI dialog so focus and overlay behavior
  match the rest of the app.
- `react-resizable-panels` — docked drawer that respects
  `--drawer-min-w` / `--drawer-default-w` / `--drawer-max-w`.
- `@tanstack/react-table` — table state (rows, columns, sort, filter,
  selection). The `DataTable` primitive renders the headless table
  through `alm-table-*` CSS.

### Component Composition

Feature pages compose primitives rather than inventing layout markup:

- `PageHeader` for top-of-page title and actions.
- `Filters` for per-page filter affordances.
- `DataTable` for the ledger body.
- `DockedDrawer` + `DrawerShell` for the right-side detail pane.
- `EmptyState` for empty/error fallbacks.

A feature page that needs a layout primitive not in `ui/` must add
it to `ui/` rather than inline-styling at the page level.

### Theme Provider

`apps/desktop/src/app/theme.tsx` exports `ThemeProvider`, `useTheme`,
and a `ThemeMode` type (`"system" | "light" | "dark"`). The provider:

1. Reads `alm.theme` from `localStorage` (defaults to `"system"`).
2. Applies the mode by writing `data-theme` on
   `document.documentElement` (or removing the attribute for
   `"system"`).
3. Resolves the effective theme (`"light"` or `"dark"`) by checking
   the OS `(prefers-color-scheme: dark)` media query when mode is
   `"system"`.
4. Persists the chosen mode back to `localStorage` on every change.
5. Listens to the media-query change event while mode is `"system"`
   so the resolved theme follows the OS without user action.

### Theme Contracts

`theme.get` and `theme.set` describe the UI-to-core boundary. The
desktop prototype satisfies them with a localStorage implementation;
a future backend (e.g. the settings store from spec 018) can
implement them server-side without changing the UI. The contracts
intentionally split `mode` (user-chosen) from `resolved`
(observed effective theme) so callers can decide which one to act
on.

**Forward-compat posture (D-022-3, GRILL 2026-05-22)**: The v1
`ThemeProvider` is the canonical implementation. The `theme.get` /
`theme.set` contracts MAY be replaced by a backend-driven settings
layer in a future revision. The contract shape is forward-compat
only and does not block v1 implementation. An envelope sweep for
these two contracts is deferred per the cross-spec deferred-sweep
note (E-026-1 / GRILL 2026-05-22 note).

### Out-of-Scope Choices (Why Each Was Rejected)

- **Mantine**: dual source of truth with the existing token CSS, plus
  a larger styled runtime than the prototype warrants. See
  `research.md` R1.
- **shadcn/ui**: requires Tailwind. Rejected; see R1.
- **Park UI / Ark UI**: smaller community than Base UI and a Tailwind
  / Panda CSS expectation that we do not want.
- **Spotlight (Mantine) for the command palette**: tied to Mantine.
  `cmdk` keeps the command palette independent of any styling kit.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations. The compositional approach is more code
than adopting a styled framework outright, but the cost is paid once
and recovered in token coherence and dependency control.
