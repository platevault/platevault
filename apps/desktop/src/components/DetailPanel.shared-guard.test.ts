/**
 * Shared-component guard — spec 054 T012a, issue #1067 (owner mandate: "the
 * panels should be completely shared components that the individual pages can
 * fill out with data").
 *
 * A static source check (in the `scripts/css-dup-sniff.mjs` spirit — cheaper
 * and just as effective as mounting all six real detail components with their
 * full data/IPC mocking, which would duplicate each feature's own test setup
 * for no extra regression coverage): every list-page detail component must
 * render through the shared `DetailPanel` (source contains a `<DetailPanel`
 * JSX usage) and must NOT render `<DetailHeader` directly — that is
 * `DetailPanel`'s own internal implementation detail, so a consumer using it
 * means it has bypassed the shared container.
 *
 * Note this deliberately does NOT forbid `DetailPane` (no "l"): the bare
 * primitive is still the correct choice for a loading/error early return,
 * which has no title to give `DetailPanel`'s required `title` prop. Several
 * of the files below use it for exactly that.
 *
 * Runtime confirmation that `DetailPanel`'s root actually carries its shared
 * structure lives in `DetailPanel.test.tsx`, which renders real instances.
