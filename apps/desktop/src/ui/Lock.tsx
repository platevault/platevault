 * (WCAG 1.4.13 / 2.1.1, same defect class as #1103):
 *
 * - The shared `Tooltip` renders its trigger as a bare `<span>` and base-ui
 *   adds no `tabIndex`, so without one the reason is reachable by pointer
 *   hover only — and the reason is not redundant prose. The cleanup-row hint
 *   ("requires explicit acknowledgement during plan review") states a
 *   consequence that appears nowhere else on screen; the adjacent pill says
 *   only "Protected".
 * - `aria-label` on a role-less `<span>` is not reliably exposed — naming
 *   applies to elements with a role that supports it — so the role is what
 *   makes the label reach assistive tech at all.
 *
 * Distinct from `InfoTip`, which supplies help text and therefore has no
 * decorative mode. See `docs/adr/0002-lock-and-infotip-stay-separate.md`.
