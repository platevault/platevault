/**
 * Checklist tooltip contract — WCAG 1.4.13 (Content on Hover or Focus).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: this tooltip was hand-rolled twice and was non-conformant
 * both times.
 *
 *  1. Pure CSS (`:hover, :focus-within { visibility: visible }`). Rows contain
 *     buttons, so clicking one left `:focus-within` true and pinned the tooltip
 *     open after the pointer had left — and CSS cannot honour Escape at all, so
 *     "Dismissable" was simply unimplementable.
 *  2. Local React state (hover + `:focus-visible` + an Escape listener). That
 *     fixed the pinning and Escape, but had no delay, no positioning and no
 *     safe-polygon path to the popup, so "Hoverable" was still shaky and it
 *     felt cheap.
 *
 * The third implementation delegates to the shared `Tooltip` primitive, which
 * satisfies all three 1.4.13 requirements via base-ui:
 *   - Dismissable — `TooltipRoot` wires `useDismiss` (escapeKey).
 *   - Hoverable   — `useHover` + `safePolygon` keep it open while the pointer
 *                   travels to the popup.
 *   - Persistent  — `closeDelay`; it never hides on a timer.
 *
 * So the conformance guard is "we still delegate": if someone reintroduces a
 * bespoke reveal here, the criterion silently regresses with no visual clue and
 * no failing test elsewhere. That is exactly what happened twice.
 *
 * Source-level on purpose: jsdom does not lay out or portal base-ui's popup
 * faithfully, so an interaction assertion here would pass vacuously and rebuild
 * the blind spot it is meant to close.
