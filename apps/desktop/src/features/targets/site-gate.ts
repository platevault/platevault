/**
 * site-gate.ts — observing-site existence gate for the planner (spec 047, D7).
 *
 * The planner renders no astronomy (Moon summary, lunar distance, filter
 * guidance, opposition) until a default `ObserverSite` exists — prompt for the
 * site first, with no location-independent fallback rendering.
 *
 * Spec 047 only *consumes* a site-existence signal; the ObserverSite model,
 * wizard step, and site CRUD are Track B (spec 044 / 048) scope. Track B has
 * now landed the `observing`-scope settings store
 * (`observing-sites/site-store`), so the gate reads the real active site: it
 * opens exactly when an observing site exists (persisted by the first-run Site
 * step or Settings → Observing Sites, both of which set the first site active),
 * and the planner then computes altitude/rise-set/imaging-time (044) and Moon
 * phase/lunar separation/filter guidance/opposition (047) against it.
