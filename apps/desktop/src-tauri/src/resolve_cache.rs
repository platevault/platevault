//! `target.cache.clear` support (spec 052 P1 FR-002): wipe the shared redb
//! resolve cache and re-warm it from the bundled seed + existing durable
//! `canonical_target` rows. Never touches `canonical_target` itself — the
//! redb cache is an explicitly reproducible projection (constitution §V).
//!
//! `simbad_resolver::Cache` exposes no delete-all primitive, so "clear" is
//! file-level: drop every handle to the old redb `Database`, delete the file,
//! reopen. [`AppState::resolve_cache`]'s write lock ensures no new reader
//! starts mid-swap; a reader that already cloned the handle just before the
//! swap keeps working against the (now-orphaned) old file until it finishes,
//! which is why the old handle is dropped before the file delete — a
//! concurrent straggler can still transiently make the delete fail on
//! Windows (sharing violation), surfaced as an error rather than silently
//! leaving a stale cache in place.
//!
//! The re-warm (bundled seed + durable `canonical_target` rows, chunked into
//! ~1000-entry `Cache::upsert_batch` write transactions per phase since spec
//! 052 P4/#695 + #818 follow-up, `Eventual`-durability since #818's second
//! follow-up — see [`targeting_resolver::simbad::ResolveCache::open`]) runs
//! as a **background task** spawned right after the swap, mirroring the
//! startup warm in `lib.rs` (issue #695: awaiting it inline froze the
//! `target.cache.clear` IPC call — and, because the write lock used to stay
//! held for the whole warm, every other resolve cache reader too — for
//! minutes on a debug build). The background task never takes
//! `AppState::resolve_cache`'s lock; it is handed the fresh cache's own
//! handle (cloned out before the swap, so it keeps warming the same
//! underlying store regardless of what `AppState::resolve_cache` is swapped
//! to next), plus a second clone of the whole [`ResolveCache`] (not just its
//! erased `.cache()`) to call [`ResolveCache::flush`] on once both phases
//! finish — the one fsync that persists every `Eventual` chunk.
//!
//! Chunking each phase's warm means nothing in a given chunk is visible to a
//! reader until THAT chunk's transaction commits (no more per-entry partial
//! visibility, but no more one-giant-atomic-transaction either) — a
//! `target.search` query racing this window can get a legitimate-looking
//! empty result for an object the seed does contain simply because its
//! chunk hasn't committed yet (issue #818). A
//! [`crate::commands::lifecycle::CacheWarmingGuard`] set true before this
//! spawn and moved into the task (so a panic mid-warm still clears it) makes
//! `AppState::cache_warming` true for the spawn's whole duration, so
//! `target.search` can surface that in-flight state and the frontend can
//! retry instead of freezing on a stale empty result.
