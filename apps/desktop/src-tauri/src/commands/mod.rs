//! Tauri command surface.
//!
//! `lifecycle` exposes the spec 002 surface as native Tauri 2 commands wired
//! through tauri-specta for TS binding generation. The legacy envelope-based
//! `OperationCommandDispatcher` boundary in `envelope` is preserved for the
//! contract test suite and any operation that does not yet have a typed
//! Tauri command.
//!
//! Spec 029 stub modules remain for command groups whose persistence layer is
//! not yet wired (sessions calendar/split/merge, review queue, preferences,
//! scan.start, equipment.list, projects.create_plan).
//!
//! Spec 030 modules add equipment CRUD, status, cleanup, calibration
//! tolerances, ingestion settings, tools, inbox scan, and cleanup scan
//! commands.
