# User journeys

End-to-end user journeys for PlateVault: what a user does, what they must
observe, validated against the running product. `FORMAT.md` is the spec for
every file in this directory; `INDEX.md` is the generated routing table
(regenerate with `journeys.py index`, never hand-edit). This file is the
per-project configuration — frontmatter holds the settings, the sections
below hold the guidance agents need to run journeys here.

Findings filed to GitHub also carry the matching `journey-<n>` label
(existing taxonomy: `journey-1` … `journey-18` correspond to J01…J18).

Two product rules cut across nearly every journey and are stated once here
instead of being repeated per journey:

- **Reviewable filesystem mutation.** Every move, copy, archive, or delete is
  proposed as a plan first; only approving and applying a plan mutates files,
  and every applied action gets an audit record.
- **Every action answers back.** Each mutating step names its success signal
  (toast, navigation, visible state change) and its failure signal (refusal
  reason, per-item error) — a badge changing somewhere else is not sufficient
  evidence of a completed step.

## Interface profiles

### desktop-ui
- kind: desktop-mcp
- exclusive: true

PlateVault ships as a Tauri v2 desktop app; the only real-app validation path
today is the Windows build driven through the Tauri MCP bridge from WSL
(`driver_session host=localhost port=9223`, mirrored WSL networking reaches
Windows services via `localhost`). `exclusive: true` because only one
validator can hold the Windows checkout/app process at a time. The
Vite/mockIPC runtime fakes backend responses and MUST NOT be used to
validate journeys (see `docs/development/testing.md`).

Launch, reset, recompile-trap, bridge-connect, native-picker, and blank-screen
mechanics are **canonical in `docs/development/windows-native-rust-dev.md`
§"Validation driving (MCP bridge, reset, recompile trap)"** — treat that doc as
authoritative rather than re-deriving the steps here. Profile-specific rules
that layer on top of it:
- Backend-only IPC probes are not a substitute for UI-level Expects — anything
  visually/interactively observable must be validated in the real webview, not
  IPC-only. Validators announce when a check is backend-only IPC and classify
  findings backend-vs-UI.
- **State-leakage prevention:** validation runs only against the Windows
  checkout's disposable dev database (`wizard-test.db` via `ALM_DB_URL`) and
  `tempfile`-style scratch folders — never against real user libraries; this
  repo checkout is never the app's working directory, so no fixture can land in
  it.

Pointers: `docs/development/windows-native-rust-dev.md` §"Validation driving"
(canonical launch/reset/recompile/bridge mechanics),
`docs/development/windows-journeys/` (per-journey Windows validation docs with
exact click sequences and troubleshooting), and `.claude/rules/50-tauri-mcp.md`
(Tauri MCP driving surface, points into the `mcp-tauri` APM context doc).

## Surface map

Maps changed file paths to journey `surfaces:` names for changed-only
validation. Agent judgment bridges anything unmapped.

| path glob | surfaces |
|---|---|
| `apps/desktop/src/features/setup/**` | setup, data-sources |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/inventory/**` | data-sources |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/inbox/**` | inbox-confirm |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/sessions/**` | sessions |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/projects/**` | projects |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/guided/**` | onboarding |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/onboarding/**` | onboarding |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/targets/**` | targets |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/targets/observing-sites/**` | observing-sites |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/calibration/**` | calibration |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/archive/**` | archive |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/plans/**` | plans |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/settings/**` | settings |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/settings/Cleanup*` | cleanup |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/settings/AuditLog*` | audit |
| `apps/desktop/src/features/settings/Equipment*` | equipment |
| `apps/desktop/src/app/**` | shell, activity |
| `crates/fs/executor/**` | plans |
| `crates/fs/inventory/**` | data-sources |
| `crates/calibration/**` | calibration |
| `crates/targeting/**` | targets |
| `crates/audit/**` | audit |

(Globs verified against the tree 2026-07-15; the Cleanup/AuditLog/Equipment
pages live as files inside `features/settings/`, so those rows are
file-prefix globs that refine the broader `settings` row. Validators should
still trust the repo over this table and propose corrections.)

## Intent-evidence sources

Where an agent should look for proof that a behavior change was intentional
(amendment gating, see FORMAT.md), in this repo's actual conventions:

- Merged PRs (`gh pr list --state merged`, `gh pr view <n>`).
- `specs/NNN-*/` SpecKit feature artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md).
- Grilling decision docs under `docs/product/`.
- `docs/development/*handover*` and orchestration/campaign logs under
  `docs/development/`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and commit messages on `main`.

A "refactor"/"cleanup" commit is NOT intent evidence for a behavior change.

## Notes

Legacy journey history (pre-migration) lives under
`docs/product/journeys/JNN-slug/` — baseline narratives plus per-task
`deltas/*.md`, and the pre-format Wave-0 rerun sheets
(`wave0-rerun-plan.md`, `wave0-task-index.md`). Those files are frozen;
this directory is where current truth now lives: all seventeen journeys
(J01–J17) are migrated and listed in `INDEX.md`.

Cross-cutting validator rules (user-mandated):

- Layout invariant: action bars/headers always visible, only content
  scrolls; verify at 1100×720.
- Reveal-control labels are OS-native ("Show in File Explorer" on Windows).
- Every campaign wave ships per-journey delta docs — Δ entries + run files
  satisfy this rule going forward.
