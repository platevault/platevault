## Goal

An efficiency-focused user drives PlateVault primarily without a mouse: jump
to any page or entity from anywhere, traverse and act on list rows, manage
persistent panel layout, and pop the current view into its own OS window for
long-running work. Done means every one of those actions is reachable,
operable, and observable using only the keyboard, from any page.

## Preconditions

- P1: The app is running with the main window focused; any library state
  (empty or populated) is sufficient to reach every step.
- P2: For the command palette's entity-search results (S1) to return
  non-empty results, at least one target, session, or project exists;
  otherwise the palette still opens and still lists pages/actions.

## Steps

### S1 — Open the command palette from anywhere {#S1}
- **Do:** Press Ctrl+K (Cmd+K on macOS) from any page; type to filter; press
  Enter on a highlighted entry; press Escape.
- **Expect:** The palette now opens as a styled floating overlay (a
  `.pv-palette*` CSS block ships it; it previously rendered as bare
  document-flow markup). It shows Pages and Actions groups; after a short
  pause (200ms debounce), typing a query that matches a target/session/
  project adds a Results group — matching is now alias-aware and
  client-side, reusing the Targets page's own tested matcher, rather than
  the backend's exact-substring SQL match (a compact query like "M31" now
  matches a spaced designation like "M 31"); the entity list is fetched
  fresh each time the palette opens. Enter on the highlighted item
  navigates to a page, jumps to the matched entity, or runs the action
  (e.g. "Open in new window" — see S2); a click on a result does the same.
  Escape closes the palette without navigating. Three of the eight Pages
  entries (`/review`, `/plans`, `/audit`) are still dead routes that
  silently redirect to the app root instead of navigating (Known gap G6,
  not addressed by this fix).
- **Expect (negative):** Pressing Ctrl/Cmd+K again while the palette is open
  closes it rather than opening a second instance.
- **Trace:** `apps/desktop/src/app/CommandPalette.tsx` (cmdk + base-ui
  Dialog), `apps/desktop/src/styles/components/target-search.css`
  (`.pv-palette*`). PR #884 fixes #581 (unstyled palette, broken alias
  matching, dead keyboard nav/clicks — a focus-ownership race between the
  input's `autoFocus` and the dialog's own focus management left cmdk's
  already-correct keyboard/click handlers unreachable). Known gap G6 (dead
  routes, issue #617) remains open.

### S2 — Pop the current view into its own window {#S2}
- **Do:** From the palette's Actions group, choose "Open in new window."
- **Expect:** A new, independent OS window opens rendering the same route;
  its lifetime and navigation are independent of the main window; the
  intended close affordance is the OS window titlebar.
- **Expect (negative):** Closing the new window never closes or navigates
  the main window, and closing the main window never force-closes windows
  opened this way.
- **Trace:** `apps/desktop/src/lib/window.ts`.

### S3 — Traverse a list page by keyboard {#S3}
- **Do:** Tab to a list page's table, move the focused row with ArrowUp and
  ArrowDown, then press Enter or Space on a focused row; separately, Tab to
  a sortable column header and activate it.
- **Expect:** Arrow keys move focus row-to-row without a pointer; Enter or
  Space on the focused row performs exactly what a click on that row would
  (typically opening its detail panel); the focused row and every
  Tab-reachable control show a visible focus ring; sortable headers are
  keyboard-reachable and expose `aria-sort` when active.
- **Expect (negative):** Moving focus with the arrow keys alone does not
  perform the row's action — only Enter/Space activates it, so keyboard
  users can browse without triggering navigation by accident.
- **Expect:** This traversal model is identical regardless of the adopting
  page's current detail-panel placement — side dock or bottom dock, on
  every page including Inbox, which shares the exact same adaptive dock as
  every other list page (see J02/S2) — since row focus/traversal is owned
  by the table, not by the detail panel (S4 covers what happens once a
  detail is open).
- **Trace:** `apps/desktop/src/ui/Table.tsx`; Known gaps G2, G7; spec-054/
  FR-012, FR-013.

### S4 — Close a list page's detail panel by keyboard {#S4}
- **Do:** With a row's detail panel open, use ArrowUp/ArrowDown to change the
  selected row, then press Escape.
- **Expect:** Moving the arrow-key selection while a detail panel is open
  moves the open detail to follow the new selection (it re-targets rather
  than closing). Pressing Escape closes the panel and returns focus to the
  list — `ListPageLayout` registers a document-level Escape keydown handler
  shared by every consumer, Inbox included (Sessions, Calibration, Targets,
  Projects, Archive, Inbox; corrected from the earlier claim that only the
  ✕ button worked, fixed by PR #906/#771 — see J04/S4, Δ4). This holds
  identically whether the detail currently renders as a side dock or a
  bottom dock (spec-054 adaptive placement, the same mechanism on every one
  of these pages including Inbox) — placement never changes the keyboard
  contract. In Inbox the detail is shown only for a selected item, so
  Escape there clears the current selection through the same shared handler
  (`onCloseDetail` → `clearSelection`), emptying the detail pane back to its
  no-selection state while the item list remains — the same "dismiss the
  open detail" contract, expressed as clearing the selection rather than
  toggling the dock closed.
- **Expect (negative):** Escape never mutates the selected record or
  triggers any state transition — it only dismisses the panel (when
  dismissal is available). An open nested dialog (e.g. a Base UI `Dialog`)
  that stops propagation on its own Escape handling closes first — the
  page-level listener only fires once no such dialog consumes the key
  first, so Escape dismisses an open overlay and leaves the underlying
  detail panel open, never both at once.
- **Trace:** `apps/desktop/src/components/ListPageLayout.tsx`; PR #906
  (fixes #771); spec-054/FR-012, FR-013.

### S5 — Layout choices persist across restart {#S5}
- **Do:** Collapse the sidebar and expand the Activity log panel, then
  restart the app.
- **Expect:** Sidebar collapse/expand state is restored after restart;
  while collapsed, each sidebar icon still exposes its full label via a
  native tooltip on hover/focus.
- **Expect (negative):** none scoped — see Known gap G4 for the log panel's
  non-persistence, which is a real gap, not a trust violation.
- **Trace:** `apps/desktop/src/app/Sidebar.tsx` (`usePreference`); Known gap
  G4.

### S6 — Overlays trap focus and close on Escape {#S6}
- **Do:** Open an overlay built on the shared Modal (the command palette,
  a confirm dialog, a plan-review overlay); press Tab repeatedly; press
  Escape.
- **Expect:** Tab cycles only among controls inside the open overlay
  (focus never escapes to the page behind it); Escape closes the overlay;
  a backdrop click also dismisses it where enabled.
- **Expect (negative):** Focus does not currently return to the control
  that opened the overlay after it closes — carried as Known gap G5, not
  claimed as working. Not every overlay in the app is built on the shared
  Modal; the exceptions in Known gap G8 do not reliably trap focus or
  close on Escape. A list page's detail dock (side or bottom placement, on
  every adopting page including Inbox, which uses the same shared adaptive
  dock as every other list page) is NOT built on Modal and carries no
  overlay/modal semantics — it never traps Tab, and Escape on it dismisses
  whichever overlay is topmost (per S4), not the page behind it.
- **Trace:** `apps/desktop/src/components/Modal.tsx`; Known gaps G5, G8;
  spec-054/FR-012, FR-013.

## Success criteria

- SC1: Ctrl/Cmd+K opens the palette from every page; 5 of the 8 routes
  listed in its Pages group resolve to an existing route today — the
  remaining 3 (`/review`, `/plans`, `/audit`) are dead links tracked as
  Known gap G6 (S1).
- SC2: 100% of rows on a list page are reachable via ArrowUp/ArrowDown and
  activatable via Enter/Space without a pointer (S3).
- SC3: Sidebar collapse/expand state matches its pre-restart value 100% of
  the time after an app restart (S5).
- SC4: "Open in new window" produces a window that survives independently
  of the main window: closing either one leaves the other window and its
  navigation state unaffected (S2).
- SC5: Every Tab-reachable control exercised in S1–S3 and S6 shows a
  visible focus indicator (S3, S6), except the specific components named
  in Known gaps G2 and G7.

## Known gaps

  — tracked as issues #581 and #617; command palette unstyled (fixed) and
  dead routes (#617, still open).

## Delta log

- **Δ2** 2026-07-15 · S1 · behavior-change
  The command palette now renders as a styled floating overlay, matches
  aliases client-side (reusing the Targets page's matcher), and its
  keyboard/click selection works reliably — a focus-ownership race
  previously left cmdk's keyboard/click handling unreachable. The 3 dead
  Pages-group routes are unaffected by this fix and remain open (#617).
  Evidence: PR #884 (fixes #581) · by: journey-scribe (intent-gated)

- **Δ3** 2026-07-17 · S3, S4, S6 · behavior-change
  The list-page detail panel now has adaptive placement (side dock on wide
  windows, bottom dock when narrow), shared by every adopting page
  including Inbox — there is no separate Inbox-only placement. Row
  traversal, arrow-key-follow into an already-open detail, and Escape-close
  are placement-neutral — identical behavior in side and bottom placement
  on every page. The dock carries no overlay/modal semantics (no focus
  trap); an open overlay's own Escape handling takes precedence, leaving
  the panel open. Also folded a stale correction:
  S4 previously described Escape as not closing the panel at all — G3 had
  already dissolved (PR #906/#771, see J04/S4 Δ4) but S4's body text was
  never updated to match.
