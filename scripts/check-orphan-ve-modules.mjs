/**
 * Orphan vanilla-extract module gate (astro-plan-ibk5).
 *
 * A `*.css.ts` module that nothing imports emits no CSS, so the styling it was
 * written to provide silently does not apply. There is no build error and no
 * failing test: the component keeps rendering, unstyled or falling back to a
 * stylesheet rule that may itself be on its way out. Two manual audits (#1572
 * and chore/mv02-dead-css) found seven of these.
 *
 * Why this script and not `knip`: knip does not report them. Verified by
 * planting an orphan `*.css.ts` and an orphan plain `.ts` under
 * `apps/desktop/src` and running both `npx knip` and `npx knip --include files`
 * — neither named either file. So the earlier suggestion that knip already
 * covers this was wrong; it does not, for VE modules or for ordinary ones.
 *
 * Liveness is reachability from the production entry point, not the presence of
 * the module's name in some file. Two weaker rules were tried and both fail
 * open:
 *
 *   - A substring search for the `<name>.css` stem passes on a mention in a
 *     migration comment, and `PropertyTable.css` contains `Table.css`, so a
 *     longer sibling's import keeps a shorter module alive.
 *   - Counting any importer treats a stylesheet imported only by a unit test as
 *     live. `components/ve-class-application.test.tsx` imports stylesheets
 *     directly, so deleting the production import would leave this gate green
 *     while the bundle lost the CSS.
 *
 * Reachability catches a third case neither reaches: a module imported only by
 * another orphan is itself dead, and the import graph says so.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. It answers one question — does the production bundle
 * reach this module — and does not attempt the harder one of whether a `.pv-*`
 * selector in a plain stylesheet still matches a rendered element. Absolute
 * orphan counts are unusable as a gate (418 of 1426 `pv-` classes are
 * unreferenced on main, most legitimately: token names, utility classes, state
 * hooks), which is why that half stays manual.
