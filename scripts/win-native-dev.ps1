.SYNOPSIS
  Launch Astro Library Manager as a native Windows Tauri app for live development.

.DESCRIPTION
  Standard procedure for native Rust + Tauri development on Windows when the
  canonical repo lives in WSL. Run this from a *Windows* checkout on an NTFS
  drive (e.g. C:\dev\astro-plan) -- NOT from a \\wsl$ / \\wsl.localhost UNC path
  (Windows node/cargo cannot build against UNC working directories).

  See docs/development/windows-native-rust-dev.md for the full runbook.

.PARAMETER Mocks
  When set, runs the frontend against in-memory fixtures (VITE_USE_MOCKS=true)
  and does not exercise the Rust backend. Default is the real backend.

.PARAMETER NoPolling
  Disable Vite file-watch polling. Polling is ON by default so edits made from
  the WSL side (via \\wsl$ or /mnt/c) reliably trigger HMR; turn it off if you
  only ever edit from Windows-native tools and want lower idle CPU.

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh -File scripts\win-native-dev.ps1            # real backend, polling on
  pwsh -File scripts\win-native-dev.ps1 -Mocks     # fixtures, no backend
