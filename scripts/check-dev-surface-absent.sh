# Asserts the developer-mode and automation surfaces are absent from a
# default-feature build of the desktop app (Constitution Principle V).
#
# Checks, all of which exit non-zero on violation:
#   1. no `default = [...]` feature list enables `dev-tools` or `e2e`
#   2. the resolved default feature graph of `desktop_shell` pulls neither
#      feature and neither gated plugin crate
#   3. no shipped capability file grants a permission from a gated plugin
#   4. no config the build reads by filename sets `withGlobalTauri`, including
#      the isolated library shell's shipped `library/tauri.conf.json`
#   5. the library shell embeds `library-dev/tauri.conf.json` only behind
#      `dev-tools` and the shipped `library/tauri.conf.json` otherwise
#
# Exit 0 requires a positive determination from every check. Each one first
# asserts that its input exists and that its query returned a record it can
# recognise, and fails when it did not: a missing manifest, an unavailable
# `cargo`, an empty or unrecognisable `cargo tree` result, and an empty
# capability directory are violations, not absence.
