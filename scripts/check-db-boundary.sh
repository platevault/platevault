# DB boundary guard — keystone enforcement for the persistence-layer boundary.
#
# Invariant: ALL production SQL lives inside `crates/persistence/db`. ZERO raw
# sqlx query/exec sites are permitted in production Rust code outside that crate.
# This script counts those sites and FAILS if any exist. The checked-in baseline
# (db-boundary-baseline.txt) is sealed EMPTY and MUST stay empty — it is a locked
# zero, not a tunable ratchet. Any new leak fails CI.
#
# History: this began as a shrink-only ratchet during the persistence-layer
# hardening effort. Once every app-layer query was drained into
# crates/persistence/db (run `db-boundary-zero`), the baseline was sealed at
# zero. New SQL must be added as a persistence/db repository method — never as an
# app-layer sqlx call.
#
# Why a script and not clippy `disallowed-methods`: clippy cannot path-scope a
# lint to "everywhere except crates/persistence/db". clippy.toml here provides a
# coarse secondary signal only; this guard is the real boundary enforcement.
#
# "Production" = `*.rs` files, excluding:
#   - crates/persistence/db/**         (the sanctioned home for SQL)
#   - any path containing a `tests/` segment (integration tests)
#   - the example reference module (query_builder_example.rs)
#   - query sites inside an inline `#[cfg(test)]` item (unit-test modules and
#     test-only helpers are not production code). Only the item's own scope is
#     exempt — production code following it in the same file is still counted.
#   - entire files the compiler excludes from production builds, i.e. file-level
#     test modules (see is_test_only_file)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-db-boundary.sh            # enforce zero (CI mode)
#   scripts/check-db-boundary.sh --generate # re-seal the empty baseline; refuses if any leak exists
#   scripts/check-db-boundary.sh --list     # print current per-file counts

# Two ways a whole file can be test-only, both checked against the compiler's
# actual rule rather than the file's name — a production file called `tests.rs`
# is still counted, which is why this is not a name-based exemption:
#
#   1. The file declares the inner attribute `#![cfg(test)]` in its header
#      region (blank/comment/attribute lines only). Note this is NOT matched by
#      the inline `#[cfg(test)]` cutoff regex below: the `!` makes it an inner
#      attribute applying to the whole file, not a cutoff for what follows.
#   2. The file is a module whose parent declares it `#[cfg(test)] mod <name>;`.
#      Extracting an inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { .. }` into its own file
#      leaves the attribute on the parent's declaration, so the file itself
#      contains no cfg(test) marker at all.
