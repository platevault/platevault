/**
 * Mock-coverage baseline gate (#1221).
 *
 * `apps/desktop/src/api/mocks.ts` mocks a subset of the generated Tauri
 * commands; the rest throw "Unknown mock command" at dispatch. That is safe
 * (loud), but a NEWLY generated command silently joins the unmocked set, and
 * mock-mode Playwright specs are the only coverage for several surfaces — so
 * the gap needs to be visible rather than discovered by a failing spec.
 *
 * `tsc` already enforces the *shapes* (mockHandlers is `satisfies
 * MockRegistry`, a mapped type over the generated `commands` object) and
 * already rejects a mock for a command that no longer exists. This gate adds
 * the axis the type system cannot express: the unmocked COUNT, pinned to a
 * checked-in baseline so it can only shrink deliberately.
 *
 * Repo precedent: scripts/check-eslint-baseline.mjs + eslint-alm-baseline.txt,
 * and scripts/check-db-boundary.sh. Unlike the db-boundary guard (sealed at
 * zero), this baseline intentionally starts non-empty and drains as mocks are
 * added.
 *
 * Deliberately regex-based over the two source files rather than type-aware:
 * it must stay runnable in `pnpm lint` without a TypeScript program, and the
 * authoritative shape checking already happens in `pnpm typecheck`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-mock-baseline.mjs              # enforce (CI mode)
 *   node scripts/check-mock-baseline.mjs --generate   # rewrite the baseline
