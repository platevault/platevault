# Dead-caller guard — fails when a module-level `pub fn` in crates/ has no
# production caller, i.e. the only code that reaches it is its own tests.
#
# The defect class: a function is implemented, unit-tested, reviewed, and
# merged, but nothing in the shipped call graph ever invokes it. Every test
# passes, so CI is green and the feature is dead from the user's perspective.
# Issues #712 (write_session_snapshot / should_snapshot), #879
# (find_or_create_{camera,telescope}_by_alias) and the Rust half of #943
# (rank_candidates) are all this shape, and all reached main.
#
# Why a script and not a rustc/clippy lint: `dead_code` does not fire on a `pub`
# item in a lib crate, and `unreachable_pub` fires on the opposite condition —
# it flags items that CANNOT be reached from outside the crate and suggests
# narrowing them to `pub(crate)`. A `pub fn` in a `pub mod` with zero callers is
# externally reachable in principle, so rustc considers it live and stays
# silent. Verified: with `#![warn(unreachable_pub, dead_code, unused)]` all
# active, rustc emits nothing for the #712 shape. `--self-test` re-proves this
# script's own detection on every run so a green result is never vacuous.
#
# Detection is name-based, so it is deliberately narrow:
#   - Definitions come only from `crates/**/src/**/*.rs`, and only from
#     functions at column 0. Anything indented is inside an `impl` block, and
#     impl methods are legitimately reached through traits or receivers that a
#     name grep cannot see. Restricting to column 0 excludes them all.
#   - References come from production Rust: `crates/**` plus
#     `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/**`, minus any `tests/` path segment, minus
#     each `#[cfg(test)]` item's own brace scope. Only that scope is exempt —
#     production code following an inline test module still counts, the same
#     rule check-db-boundary.sh applies. Comment lines are stripped, so a doc
#     comment naming a function does not disguise it as live.
#
# The baseline (dead-callers-baseline.txt) lists names already dead when the
# guard landed. It is a shrink-only ratchet: names may be removed as the debt is
# wired up or deleted, but a name that is not in the baseline fails the build.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-dead-callers.sh             # enforce (CI mode)
#   scripts/check-dead-callers.sh --list      # print current dead names
#   scripts/check-dead-callers.sh --generate  # rewrite the baseline
#   scripts/check-dead-callers.sh --self-test # prove the detector still detects

# Emit paths (one per line, in the same string form `find` would print them,
# since resolution starts from a path `find` already returned) of files that
# are out-of-line test modules: `#[cfg(test)] mod name;` in some other file,
# with the body living in a sibling `name.rs` or `name/` directory per Rust's
# module-file convention. Unlike `mod tests { ... }`, these files carry no
# #[cfg(test)] attribute of their own (it lives only on the declaration) and
# their directory need not be named `tests`, so neither the defs/corpus name
# filters nor the corpus brace-scope skip below can see them — they must be
# excluded by resolved path instead. A directory-form sibling is excluded
# wholesale (not just its mod.rs) so a further out-of-line submodule declared
# inside it (no attribute of its own needed — the cfg(test) gate is inherited
# from the parent) is swept up too.
#
# Assumes the attribute sits on its own line directly above the declaration
# (rustfmt's default, and the only shape found in this tree) — a same-line
# `#[cfg(test)] mod x;` is not matched.
#
# Cleans up $pairs directly rather than via `trap ... RETURN`: this function
# nests inside collect_dead (which sets its own RETURN trap), and bash RETURN
# traps are a single shell-wide slot, not a per-call stack — the inner trap
# would silently replace the outer one for the rest of the shell's life, the
# same pre-existing hazard that already applies to self_test calling
# collect_dead.

Each named function is implemented and tested but never called by shipped code,
so it is dead from the user's perspective while CI stays green.

Fix by wiring the function into its production call path. If it is genuinely
not needed, delete it. If it is intentionally unreferenced (a trait-object-only
entry point, a re-exported public API), add it to
scripts/dead-callers-baseline.txt with a comment saying why.
