# DB boundary ratchet — fail if production sqlx query/exec sites OUTSIDE
# crates/persistence/* EXCEED the checked-in baseline. Counts may only shrink.

# Dead-caller ratchet — fail if a module-level `pub fn` in crates/ has no
# production caller, i.e. only its own tests reach it. rustc cannot catch this:
# `dead_code` does not fire on `pub` items in a lib crate, and `unreachable_pub`
# flags the opposite condition. Shrink-only baseline; refresh after wiring up or
# deleting debt:
#   bash scripts/check-dead-callers.sh --generate

# Lifecycle string-comparison ratchet — sealed at zero. Raw `.lifecycle == "..."`

# Hot-read ratchet — fail if per-operation hot-read call sites in the inbox /
# plan-apply / watcher paths exceed the checked-in baseline. Shrink-only:
# any new site fails CI. After removing a site, regenerate the baseline:
#   bash scripts/check-hot-read-ratchet.sh --generate

# Periodic hygiene sweeps. NOT CI gates and deliberately so: these surface debt
# to triage, not per-PR correctness, and a noisy blocking gate gets suppressed.
# Run them when you want a health read, not on every push.
#
# Tools install on demand:
#   cargo install cargo-machete cargo-public-api
#
# Deliberately NOT included, so nobody re-adds them:
#   cargo-udeps  - same job as machete, and needs a nightly toolchain
#   cargo-shear  - same job as machete; one dependency checker is enough,
#                  three reporting overlapping findings guarantees all three
#                  get ignored
#   warnalyzer   - NOT dead (an earlier note here said so, wrongly: crates.io
#                  shows a 2021 release, but the repo was pushed 2024-09 and
#                  has a SCIP backend that works on stable). Not wired up only
#                  because the SCIP route is covered below.
#
# WORTH EVALUATING, not yet wired: cargo-workspace-unused-pub does exactly what
# scripts/check-dead-callers.sh approximates, but semantically -- it builds a
# SCIP index via rust-analyzer instead of grepping, so re-exports, out-of-line
# test modules and comments cannot fool it (all four bugs found in that script
# on 2026-07-20 were grep artifacts). Caveats: 0.1.0, ~1.3k downloads, methods
# only, no false-positive suppression yet, and index generation is slow enough
# that it is a periodic sweep rather than a gate. warnalyzer and clippy issue
# 5828 both confirm SCIP + rust-analyzer is the only workable approach --
# rustc's dead_code is per-crate by construction and cannot see a workspace.
