//! Spec 037 Layer-2 real-UI journeys — Inbox (batch #6 of the coverage-matrix
//! "Batched plan"): the UI-level gate + reclassify + confirm/apply surface
//! that `journeys.rs`'s `plan_review_apply_with_audit` proves only through
//! the `window.__PV_E2E__.invoke` bridge, never by clicking through the real
//! Inbox page (`apps/desktop/src/features/inbox/{InboxPage,InboxDetail,
//! PlanPanel}.tsx`).
//!
//! Per the manual click-by-click specs this promotes to automation:
//! `docs/development/windows-journeys/journey-02-inbox-ingest-move.md` and
//! `journey-03-inbox-catalogue-in-place.md`.
//!
//! Setup steps that need the native OS folder picker (registering a root,
//! flipping its `organization_state`) stay on the `invoke` bridge — the same
//! documented constraint `journeys.rs` already carries. Everything a real
//! user would click (Rescan, selecting a detection row, the bulk-reclassify
//! controls, Confirm, opening the plan-review overlay, Apply) is driven
//! through real `data-testid` DOM elements via the helpers in `common/mod.rs`.

/// NOTE: written but NOT YET EXECUTED (authored alongside the fix without a

/// The defect this pins, end to end: `classify()` writes
/// `inbox_classifications.result = "unclassified"` (step 8 — zero distinct
/// frame types) and then unconditionally flips `inbox_items.state` to
/// `"classified"` (step 9) for that SAME placeholder id, so a `state`-only

/// reports unclassified. The three sibling journeys above all passed
/// identically with and without the fix — they assert on
/// `inbox-unclassified-alert`, Confirm enablement, and move counts, and never
/// read the Type column.
///
/// Fixture choice — the same unmapped-`IMAGETYP` file as
/// `inbox_ui_unclassified_gate_bulk_reclassify_unblocks_confirm`, written with
/// [`write_minimal_fits`] (which deliberately omits `EXPTIME`). It is the only
/// shape that can reach the new predicate at all:
/// - Zero distinct frame types → folder result `"unclassified"`, and
///   `materialize_sub_items` yields exactly ONE group (the `__needs_review__`
///   sentinel). One group is not a split, so the placeholder row survives
///   `exclude_split_placeholder!`'s `> 1` bound
///   (`crates/persistence/inbox/src/repositories/inbox`) and stays in
///   `inbox.list`.
/// - A MIXED folder (2+ types) also stores `"unclassified"`, but it genuinely
///   SPLITS, so its placeholder is filtered out of `inbox.list` entirely and
///   could never exercise this path.
///
/// The needs-review trap: `isNeedsReview` runs BEFORE the new predicate in
/// `classificationLabel`, so a row in the sentinel bucket is labelled "needs
/// review" and proves nothing here. The row under test is the PLACEHOLDER
/// (`group_key = ""`, and `inbox.list` always returns an empty
/// `missingMandatory` — the other `isNeedsReview` signal — see
/// `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/inbox.rs`), which lists ALONGSIDE its
/// one needs-review sub-item. Hence the assertions run over every Type cell
/// rather than one row: "needs review" is expected and fine, "classified" is
/// the defect.
