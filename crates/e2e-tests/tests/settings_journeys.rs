//! Spec 037 Layer-2 real-UI journeys — Settings auto-save + theme persistence
//! (batch #11 of the coverage-matrix "Batched plan", Journey 10). Promotes
//! two of `docs/development/windows-journeys/journey-10-settings-appearance-i18n.md`'s
//! Tests: #1 (pane grouping / no global Save) + #4 (a setting persists
//! through the real backend) combined into one journey, and #2 (theme
//! applies live and survives a restart) as a second.
//!
//! Deliberately scoped to these two: they're real, cheap, deterministic UI
//! state/persistence checks with no native OS dialogs involved — the
//! "lowest filesystem-mutation risk" batch per the coverage matrix. The
//! remaining Tests (ingestion-settings-persist-across-restart, altitude
//! clamp, log-panel layout/export, 1100x720 layout convention, translated
//! backend-error surfacing, command palette, sidebar persistence) are left
//! as documented follow-ups — several need either a scrollable content
//! fixture or a real backend-rejected action reachable without a native
//! dialog, which would meaningfully grow this file's scope.
//!
//! Note on cross-session persistence and `E2eApp::launch()`/`relaunch()`:
//! both reset the SQLite DB on every call (`reset_database()`), so a
//! backend-persisted setting (e.g. Ingestion's toggles, which round-trip
//! through `ingestion.settings.get`/`update` into the same DB) CANNOT be
//! proven to survive a relaunch in this harness — the DB reset would erase
//! it regardless of whether the real app would have kept it. The
//! ingestion-settings-persist-across-restart scenario (journey-10 Test 4) is
//! left as a follow-up for that reason, not an oversight.
//!
//! (theme-settings-db, 2026-07-09) The theme choice used to be the one
//! exception — purely `localStorage`-backed
//! (`apps/desktop/src/data/theme.ts`), and therefore untouched by
//! `reset_database()`, which is why the original version of Test 2 below
//! asserted it survived a `relaunch()`. Theme is now DB-backed (settings
//! `general` scope, `theme` key) so the WebView2 force-kill data-loss finding
//! (a graceful shutdown flushes `localStorage`'s LevelDB store; a forced kill
//! does not) can't silently lose the user's choice. `localStorage` is kept
//! only as a synchronous boot cache, reconciled from the DB by
//! `hydrateThemeFromSettings()` shortly after boot. That moves theme into the
//! same "cannot be proven to survive a relaunch in this harness" bucket as
//! Ingestion above — this harness's `reset_database()` wipes the very row
//! `hydrateThemeFromSettings()` would otherwise confirm survived, and will
//! instead reconcile the boot cache back to the default. Test 2 below is
//! trimmed to the live-apply assertion only (unaffected by the DB reset); a
//! true cross-relaunch proof needs a harness `ResetScope` that preserves the
//! DB, left as a follow-up alongside Ingestion's.
