//! Canonical `(entity_type, from, to) → action_critical_fields[]` table
//! (spec 002 FR-009/FR-010, T050).
//!
//! Authored from data-model.md §Action-Bound Review. The transition use case
//! looks up this table on every edge attempt; for each listed field path it
//! fetches the field's provenance origin and refuses the transition with
//! `provenance.unreviewed` when any required field is not yet `reviewed`.
//!
//! Field-level review state is derived from each field's
//! [`ProvenancedValue::origin`] — it is NOT a per-entity column. The
//! repository surface for that read is
//! [`LifecycleRepository::field_origins`].
//!
//! Spec 041 FR-051 (T076, Phase 13): the only cells ever populated here gated
//! the `AcquisitionSession`/`InventorySession` `candidate → confirmed` and
//! `needs_review → confirmed` edges (confirming a session required
//! `observer_location` to be reviewed). Those edges — and the entity types
//! that carried them — no longer exist: sessions are derived,
//! already-confirmed inventory with no review transition. [`TABLE`] is
//! therefore empty; the mechanism remains in place for a future entity
//! family that needs action-bound review.
