//! Spec 049 US1: `sourceview.generate` — first-materialization of a project
//! source view as a reviewable `prepared_view_generation` plan.
//!
//! Companion to `crate::prepared_views` (spec 026 remove/regenerate), which
//! this module reuses unchanged: the `PreparedSourceView` /
//! `PreparedSourceViewItem` entities, the project-lifecycle gate, and the
//! spec 017/025 plan review→approve→apply pipeline. The first-materialization
//! DB write itself happens on successful apply
//! (`app_core::plan_apply::finalize_view_generation`), not here — this use
//! case only builds and persists the reviewable plan (FR-001).
//!
//! ## Scope (US1 MVP superseded by US2 profile-driven layout)
//!
//! - Selection is **session-level** (spec 048 per-frame selection is a
//!   separate follow-up, CL-9): every project-linked `acquisition_session`
//!   (`project_sources`) contributes all of its **present** frames.
//! - Layout is **profile-driven** (spec 049 US2 T025/T026): the active
//!   project's tool profile (`req.profile_id`, else `projects.tool`, resolved
//!   against `workflow_profiles::seed`) supplies a
//!   [`workflow_profiles::SourceViewLayout`] — a `{token}` directory pattern
//!   for lights (WBPP default: `{date}/{filter}/{exposure}/`, i.e.
//!   session/night → filter → exposure) resolved via
//!   [`patterns::resolve_pattern_str`] against the shared v1 token registry,
//!   plus a calibration-location pattern. Every matched calibration set still
//!   gets its own subdirectory beneath that location (keyed by `master_id`)
//!   so collisions stay impossible by construction (FR-009a/CL-5) without
//!   needing a `master_id` metadata token in the shared registry.
//! - Calibration selection (T027): `calibration_assignment.master_id` always
//!   resolves to a `calibration_session` row. This codebase's calibration
//!   matching engine (`calibration_core::MasterInfo`) has no raw-vs-master
//!   branch at that level — the raw/master distinction (spec 040 `is_master`)
//!   is resolved earlier, during inbox confirm, onto
//!   `inbox_classification_evidence`, and is not carried onto
//!   `calibration_session`/`calibration_assignment`. So "masters when the
//!   match resolved masters, else the matched raw calibration sets" (FR-010/
//!   CL-4) already holds trivially today: there is exactly one resolved frame
//!   set per assignment, and it is linked as-is. If a future schema change
//!   lets one assignment carry both a master and a raw fallback, this
//!   function's calibration loop is the place to add masters-preferred
//!   branching.
//!
//! Split by responsibility (refactor sweep #983): [`generate`] owns the
//! `generate_source_view` pipeline; [`destination_override`] is the T041
//! per-project destination override KV read/write; the pure path/layout
//! helpers below are shared by both.
