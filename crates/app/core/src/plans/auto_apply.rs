/// Constitution II nuance (user decision 2026-07-04, supersedes handover D16):
/// the reviewable plan record and the full per-action audit trail are STILL
/// written — only the approval *click* is skipped, and only when the plan
/// creates app-owned structure and touches no user file:
///
/// - every action is `mkdir` (directory creation) or `write_manifest` (the
///   app-owned project-marker record item that accompanies the scaffolding
///   mkdirs; the executor performs no user-file mutation for it), and
/// - at least one action is `mkdir`.
///
/// Any user-file action — `move`, `copy`, `link`, `delete`, `archive`,
/// `trash`, `catalogue`, or anything unrecognised — disables auto-apply and
/// the plan goes through the normal review flow unchanged.
