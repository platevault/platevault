//! Path-set overlap comparison for the cross-plan concurrency guard
//! (spec 025 FR-017 / R-Concur-1, T007).
//!
//! Two plans may apply concurrently only if their (source ∪ destination ∪
//! archive) path sets are disjoint at subtree-prefix granularity. This module
//! owns the pure comparison; the apply use case computes each plan's claimed
//! paths and calls [`PlanPathSet::first_overlap`] before registering a run.
//!
//! Inputs are expected to be **lexically normalized** paths (no `.` / `..`
//! components) that are absolute whenever the owning library root is known.
//! Comparison is component-wise (via [`Utf8Path::starts_with`]), so sibling
//! names that share a string prefix (`/a/b` vs `/a/bc`) do NOT overlap.
//! Comparison is case-sensitive; case-insensitive filesystem semantics are a
//! documented future refinement (research R7).
