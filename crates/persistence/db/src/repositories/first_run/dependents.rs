/// plan-apply — see `app_targets::ingest_sessions`) AND `inbox_items` (items
/// scanned into the Inbox but not yet ingested — these live under the
/// *inbox* root's own id, which never gets `file_record` rows, since ingest
/// writes `file_record` against the *destination* root instead). A root that
/// was only ever scanned into the Inbox previously sampled as empty here,
/// which made a remap preview vacuously report "all verified" with nothing
/// actually checked.
///
/// `inbox_items` rows in the terminal `resolved` state are excluded: those
/// items were already moved out of this root by a prior plan-apply, so their
/// `relative_path` legitimately no longer exists at the root's original
/// location regardless of any remap — checking them would produce false
/// "not found" results unrelated to the remap itself.
///
/// No `LIMIT` — a prior 5-path sample let files outside the sample go
/// unverified; correctness (this gates a destructive-adjacent path swap) is
/// prioritised over the sample being lighter to render.
///
/// Deduplicated (`UNION`) and ordered for determinism. Roots with no rows in
/// either table (calibration/project roots, or raw roots registered directly
/// without ever receiving an inbox scan) yield an empty result — there is
/// nothing recorded to verify.
