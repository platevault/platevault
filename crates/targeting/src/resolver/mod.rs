//! Target resolution module (spec 035: SIMBAD Target Resolution).
//!
//! Resolves astronomical target identities on demand against SIMBAD, backed by
//! a bundled seed index and a local SQLite cache. This module owns the
//! resolver seam (a testable [`Resolver`] trait — implemented later by
//! `SimbadResolver` and a [`FakeResolver`]), the cache read/write layer, and
//! the bundled-seed loader.
//!
//! This is metadata/identity resolution only — no image processing
//! (PixInsight boundary, constitution §III).
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! - [`simbad`]: SIMBAD TAP/Sesame HTTP client (`reqwest`) → canonical identity.
//! - [`cache`]: cache read/write, dedupe by SIMBAD oid, source precedence.
//! - [`caldwell`]: static C1–C109 → NGC/IC designation map (Caldwell is not in SIMBAD).
//! - [`seed`]: bundled-seed load at first run.
//!
//! # The resolver seam (T004)
//!
//! [`Resolver`] is the no-network-in-unit-tests seam, mirroring the retired
//! `download::CatalogFetcher`/`FakeFetcher` pattern: production code uses the
//! `reqwest`-backed `SimbadResolver` (see [`simbad`], T019); the search /
//! resolve / ingest-queue logic is unit-tested offline with [`FakeResolver`].
