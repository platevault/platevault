//! Pins the two out-of-crate seed blobs embedded by `src/seed.rs` to committed
//! SHA-256 literals, so a byte change inside a multi-megabyte JSON file is
//! visible in review instead of invisible.
//!
//! Two invariants make this non-vacuous and must survive any edit here:
//!
//! - The bytes come from `include_bytes!` of the same paths the production
//!   loaders use, so a wrong path fails at compile time and the digest covers
//!   what actually ships rather than a file re-read at test runtime.
//! - The expected values are literals a human edits. Deriving them from the
//!   working tree (a recipe, a `SHA256SUMS` file, a `build.rs`) would give a
//!   swapped blob a matching digest in the same commit.
//!
//! No OS `cfg` gate and no newline normalization: `.gitattributes` pins
//! `assets/seed/*.json` to `eol=lf` so these digests hold on every platform,
//! and normalizing bytes before hashing would defeat a byte digest.
