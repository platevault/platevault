//! SIMBAD resolver adapter: delegates to the published `simbad-resolver`
//! crate's own [`simbad_resolver::SimbadResolver`] cache-first facade (spec
//! 052 P1, D1) rather than calling [`simbad_resolver::TapResolver`] directly.
//!
//! The facade owns cache-first resolution (persistent redb, [`cache::ResolveCache`]),
//! Caldwell translation, and (from 0.2.0) `v_mag` enrichment; this module is a
//! thin boundary converting between astro-plan's stable local resolver types
//! (unchanged public API since spec 035 — every existing call site keeps
//! compiling untouched) and the crate's types.
//!
//! ## Cache lifetime (D2 — one global redb file, no TTL)
//!
//! [`cache::ResolveCache`] wraps the crate's [`simbad_resolver::Store`] (an `Arc`
//! handle over one open `redb::Database`) and is opened ONCE at app startup
//! (`<app_data>/simbad-cache.redb`); every [`resolver::SimbadResolver`] built afterward
//! (settings changes rebuild the resolver, e.g. after `target.resolution
//! .settings.update`) shares that same store via a cheap clone
//! ([`CacheBackend::custom`]) instead of re-opening the file.
//!
//! ## Dual lookup (spec 052 P2, D5 — TAP-first, Sesame fallback)
//!
//! [`resolver::SimbadResolver`] wraps TWO facade instances sharing the SAME
//! [`cache::ResolveCache`]: `typeahead` (the [`Resolver`] trait impl — TAP +
//! cache only, used by the debounced as-you-type path) and
//! `explicit` (consulted only by `resolve_explicit` — TAP
//! first, [`simbad_resolver::SesameResolver`] fallback only on a TAP miss).
//! This two-entrypoint split is what makes FR-009 ("the fallback MUST NOT
//! fire during as-you-type suggestions") a structural guarantee rather than a
//! runtime flag the typeahead call site could forget to pass: the typeahead
//! path's resolver type ([`network_resolvers::EitherNetworkResolver`]) has no Sesame reference to
//! call, at any query. Both facades share one [`cache::ResolveCache`], so a
//! Sesame-recovered identity is cached/deduped exactly like a TAP hit.
//!
//! Split by responsibility (refactor sweep #993): [`cache`] is the durable
//! resolve-cache handle; [`network_resolvers`] are the small `Resolver`
//! compositions ([`network_resolvers::EitherNetworkResolver`],
//! [`network_resolvers::DualLookupResolver`],
//! [`network_resolvers::ExplicitNetworkResolver`]) `resolver::SimbadResolver`
//! is built from; [`resolver`] is the production `SimbadResolver` facade
//! itself plus [`resolver::OfflineResolver`]; [`convert`] holds the
//! boundary conversions between astro-plan's local types and the upstream
//! crate's types.
