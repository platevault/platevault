//! Bundled-seed loader: warms the persistent redb resolve cache at first run
//! (spec 035 T016/R3; retargeted to redb by spec 052 P1 D2/D4/T012).
//!
//! Loads the bundled seed index (popular catalogue objects: the Messier
//! catalogue, the Caldwell objects, and a slice of NGC/IC) into the shared
//! [`crate::simbad::ResolveCache`] with `source = seed`. Seed rows are
//! superseded by `resolved`/`user-override` entries per the source-precedence
//! rules the crate's own [`simbad_resolver::Cache::upsert`] enforces, so this
//! load is safe to re-run.
//!
//! The redb cache is a **reproducible projection** (constitution §V) — it is
//! never the durable record. `canonical_target` in SQLite stays durable and is
//! written ONLY at an in-use commit ([`crate::cache::upsert_resolved`]); this
//! module also lazily copies any EXISTING durable rows into the cache
//! ([`warm_from_canonical_target`]) so targets adopted by a prior app version
//! (or a different machine sharing the SQLite file) still participate in
//! typeahead/search.
//!
//! # Asset format
//!
//! The committed asset (`assets/seed/seed.json`) is a JSON document:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "version": 1,
//!   "generated_at": "2026-06-18T00:00:00Z",
//!   "source": "SIMBAD TAP (CDS) + OpenNGC",
//!   "entries": [
//!     {
//!       "simbad_oid": 1575544,
//!       "primary_designation": "M 31",
//!       "common_name": "Andromeda Galaxy",
//!       "object_type": "galaxy",
//!       "ra_deg": 10.6847083,
//!       "dec_deg": 41.26875,
//!       "v_mag": 3.44,
//!       "aliases": [
//!         { "alias": "M 31", "kind": "designation" },
//!         { "alias": "NGC 224", "kind": "designation" },
//!         { "alias": "Andromeda Galaxy", "kind": "common_name" }
//!       ]
//!     }
//!   ]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `v_mag` is optional (`#[serde(default)]`) since not every SIMBAD object
//! carries `allfluxes.V` photometry (galaxies and pure nebulae are frequently
//! `None`; see `bundled_asset_has_v_mag_coverage` for the measured
//! per-object-type split). The committed asset was regenerated after the
//! seed-builder V-magnitude fix (spec 052 P1 T003, #684) landed — see #696.
//!
//! The asset is built once, offline, by the `seed-builder` tool; see
//! `crates/tools/seed-builder`.
