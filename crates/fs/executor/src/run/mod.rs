//! Sequential per-item executor loop (spec 025, T013).
//!
//! Walks an approved plan's items in order. For each item:
//!   1. Check cancellation token (between items only — never mid-item).
//!   2. Check skip-set (user-requested skips injected between items).
//!   3. Check per-item FS CAS snapshot (R-FS-1).
//!   4. Perform the filesystem operation.
//!   5. Emit progress event via callbacks.
//!   6. Re-check retry-queue before advancing.
//!
//! Pause conditions (`volume.unavailable`, `disk.full`, `item.stale`)
//! halt the loop and return `ApplyOutcome::Paused`.
//!
//! Cancellation halts forward progress; remaining pending items are
//! batched to `cancelled` by the caller (app/core use case).
//!
//! This module has NO database or audit bus dependencies — those are
//! injected via `ExecutorCallbacks` so the crate can be unit-tested
//! with an in-process fake.
//!
//! Constitution §II: never overwrite silently; per-item audit via callbacks.
//!
//! Split by responsibility (refactor sweep #985): this file holds the
//! shared public types (progress events, item/action model, cancellation +
//! skip + retry coordination primitives); [`loop_`] is the `execute_plan`
//! forward loop + per-item gate pipeline; [`dispatch`] is the pure
//! action→filesystem-op dispatch.
